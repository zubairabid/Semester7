**Question**: 
*Which of these two ideas take explanatory primacy in explaining the rise of 
official and colonial nationalisms: the concept of bounded, border contained 
journeys, or the idea of print-capitalism combined with school education?*

# Outline

- Introduction:
    - What isn't: language, uniformity of language. 
    - Will specifically be one of those two, and here I think it will be print
      capitalism.
- Motivating with some context on Anderson's words on these with respect to
  Creole nationalism and Beginnings of European national "awakening":
    - First, why it isn't about just having same languages. Europe had common
      vernacular amongst peasantry long before.
    - Second, having same language is not a prerequisite for the nation. Early
      stage Latin America. There's some shared journey here.
    - Third, on why it's print: Anderson commented on this, wrt Creole
      nationalism - the shared journey exists for quite a while before the
      revolution(s).
    - Finally, idea of the "memory of print" that we will use.
- Now, we move on to examples
- First, let's consider Border-contained journeys.


# Points

- ~~So official nationalism is a reactionary response to european awakening.~~
- ~~Monarchs adopting the nationalist garb to maintain power.~~
- ~~Official nationalism is as border-contained as European nationalism is,
  hence by language.~~
- Under a common bureaucracy, journeys converge to be largely the same.
- It has to be preceded by Print Capitalism to set the structures in place
  first.
- Without print capitalism, there is no separation of administrative units. The
  monarchs are all interrelated via marriage, and no scope for vertical growth
  exists. In the feudal case, the heirs ascend via death. No common journey.
  Trade with each other is possible, so it's not unusual to move about. Consider
  Victoria, Queen of "England". Essentially, no common journeys separating the
  common folk across Europe. Even when as
  colonisers, they are the colonisers - those native to the land are capable of
  moving about as they please.
- Print capitalism allows for ideas of plurality, extra-European antiquity.
- A kinship separated by language that allows.

- Colonial and border-contained journeys: yes. See Scotland, vs all of British
  colonies, japanese colonies, etc. Borders as a source of resentment.
- A newspaper informing of events and allowing for dead time required to imagine
  the journey. Else you have the loneliness, but no apparent companionship.
- School system introduces another journey, from the villages through towns up
  to the apex at the cities.
- Indonesia being preserved through a common schooling.
- India and pakistan, common journeys and vernacular media split
