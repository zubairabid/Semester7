**Question**: 
*Which of these two ideas take explanatory primacy in explaining the rise of 
official and colonial nationalisms: the concept of bounded, border contained 
journeys, or the idea of print-capitalism combined with school education?*

# Introduction

For the purpose of deciding the primacy of explanatory ideas, I'll be using
Anderson's "Imagined Communities - Reflections on the Origin and Spread of
Nationalism" [-@anderson_imagined_2006]. I will trying to explain why I think
that print capitalism combined with school education takes explanatory primacy
over the "shared journey", although that is almost as important.

To strengthen the argument, it's also important to realise that it's
specifically these two (shared journeys and print capitalism) that enable the
rise of nationalisms. Nationalist sentiments don't materialise simply among
those sharing a common language, and in fact having the same language is not
even a necessity. We begin by diving right into this.

# Lessons from Creole and European Linguistic Nationalism

## Why it isn't about a Common Language:

Theories of nations as requiring a common language aren't uncommon, with several
early theorists having posited such based on observation. @nairn_break-up_2003
talks of 'the masses' being 'invited into history' by middle-class 
intelligentsia, something only possible through a language they (the
masses) understood; laying a framework for linguistic nationalism. But no
explanation is given for the popularity of the idea, on why exactly this would
appeal to either the masses or the middle-class intelligentsia, unless as 
Anderson says we "turn finally to piracy" [^andpir]

And it isn't necessary that a common language invites nationalist sentiments. 
As we see from the chapter on creole nationalism, 
a common language did not unify the Latin American nations, but neither 
did the lack of one among the multiple ethnicities living there separate them
from rallying under the flag of a single nation [^andcre1].

## A strong case for print primacy over the shared journey:

Anderson points out that in Madrid-controlled
America, the shared journey had existed for almost three centuries
[^andcretime] before the whole region split into the eighteen different nations.
He raises two factors used to explain the sudden rise of
nationalism: the tightening of Madrid's control, and "the spread of
liberalizing ideas of the Enlightenment". 

The latter is only possible in an environment of print capitalism -
even though it had not yet "reached
these illiterates", serialised newspapers were a thing - allowing for a plural
imagination of a shared time-space where said journeys could be committed to the
memory of print, enabling them to be "shared". Print capitalism manifested in
the newspaper thus became a prerequisite for the shared journey to be realised
as 'shared' and then actualised in the first place.
 
For the rest of this essay, we will be taking (theory and) examples from the
latter two stages, Official Nationalism and Colonial Nationalism (as a subset of
the Last Wave), to
demonstrate that this prerequisite nature applies across the board.

## Examining Official Nationalisms

Official nationalisms aren't a bottom-up movement in themselves, but an 
attempt by the existing State to retain its power by co-opting 19th Century
Europe's linguistic nationalism. [^offintro] As a result of such, there is no
theoretical explanation to them as such, and we must then explore how the
previous stage comes into being. 
So, we need to show primacy of print capitalism in
Linguistic nationalism.

### Europe's linguistic nationalism could not come from shared journey

The middle class' rise as
the literate bourgeoisie, imagining fraternity within limitations of mutual
intelligibility is key to European linguistic nationalism
[@anderson_imagined_2006, pp. 77-78], however 
print capitalism did exist in Europe for quite a bit before nationalist
sentiments finally came to light [^printing]. So one may assume it is not the 
primary motivation behind the rise of the nationalisms, and the common bounded
journey might have a play here.
 
This is an incorrect assumption:
- There is no way to have "common journeys" that would split Europe
  the way the Americas were. The states were not colonial but central, so the
  bureaucracy was not bounded the way it was in the colonies.
- We might venture to say that in the colonies bureaucracy and the quest
  for positions by merit birthed the shared journey. 
  Pre-national Europe has none of that. The ruling class
  is more a large family of interconnected second and third cousins [^hanovereg]
  so they are not thinking in terms of nations. In feudal conditions
  too, power is hereditary and passed on by death [^andfeud]. There cannot be a
  shared journey if there isn't much of a journey to begin with.
- This is not to say the shared journey didn't play a part in official
  nationalisms - but much later. The separate bureaucracies allow 
  for a common journeys among "countrymen" distinct from that of another, 
  serving to strengthen the national bonds, *but the existence of said 
  bureaucracies has to be preceded by print capitalism creating the 
  awareness of nations and distinction in the first place*.

### The role of print in opening up imaginations

Print was necessary for realisation of "non-divinity" of languages,
giving rise to the identification of languages with their native speakers as
since now no language was "holy", who else to identify it with than with its
native speakers?
[@anderson_imagined_2006, pp. 69]. It also allowed for the growth of
comparative history through popular reading of others, leading to the thought of
Europe as one among many civilizations, as opposed to the only one
[^andcomplang].

### Incoming: State monopoly on education

Although seen in full force later in Colonial nationalism (which we will explore
in a minute), official nationalism is also where we begin to see the impact of a 
State monopoly on Education. Prominent examples being of course, Russification
and Macaulayism. A formal study of requiring nationalism to be a dual-pronged
approach was studied by Hobsbawn much after, [^hobsclass] , but the idea is 
simple -
educate the masses with a common language that allows them to see whatever has
been defined for them as the Nation-state, along with the opportunity to
participate in government. In colonial nations this allows a new kind of
shared journey to arise, which we will discuss in a minute.

With this evidence for the primacy of Print Nationalism and Education over
Shared Journey in Official nationalism, we move on to the Colonial cases.

## Examining Colonial Nationalisms

### A significant display of border-contained journeys

Colonial nations are a lot more demonstrative of the issue of border-contained
journeys, because of the overwhelming parallels to their creole partners.
For a quick example, consider the non-demonstration of nationalist
sentiment from Scotland due to their freedom of movement in an around all of
England, versus a nation like Ireland. [^andscot]

Several examples can be taken: the desire of independence of Cambodia from 
Vietnam, due to limitations placed on the Khmer [@anderson_imagined_2006]. 
In India, Bipin Chandra Pal is well known for his comments on Indians educated
in British ways who are both not allowed to operate outside of India, and also
cut off from the orthodox Hindu Communion [@pal_memories_1932 pp. 409]. Using
parallels to the creoles, it is clear that there is some degree of "shared
journey".

On closer examination, however - this only applies *once* some degree of
education, or some system is in place to permit such situations to rise in the
first place.

### State-monopoly on Education

Natives getting into administrative positions only to be limited by boundaries
and sharing a common goal cannot happen when they aren't educated by the State
to fill roles in government in the first place.

However, Education's role in nationalism extends beyond that. Take the case of
Indonesia (some of this applies to India too) - the government
schools provided regulated gradations by age groups, and as one moved up from
primary to secondary and then tertiary, a shared
journey from the villages to the town centers [^andindoeduc].
It has more visible effects too; despite federalist policy exploiting
ethnic differences, Indonesia does not split apart [^andindoeduc].

### Print Capitalism's necessity and role beyond

It goes without saying that the above could not happen without print capitalism.

There is more print capitalism contributes than just a means for Education, of
course. Mirroring the creoles again, is the role of the newspaper as
manifestation, allowing the growth of vernacular. [^andnews]
Newspapers also ended up playing significant roles directly in several struggles
for Independence [^newsind].
