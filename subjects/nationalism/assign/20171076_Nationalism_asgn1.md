**Question**: 
*How are nations like communities? Is there is a difference between 
the communities which are formed by civic and ethnic nationalisms?*

*(Write an essay (800-1200 words) explaining your answer. Draw on examples of at 
least two nations and nationalisms other than India.)*

# Introduction 

Most widely-accepted notions of nations today have a common grounding in
considering them to be *communities* of people: from Stalin and Seton-Watson's
definitions to Benedict Anderson's. But the manner of these people "coming 
together", as it were, also differs from one nation to another. The *conception*
of a nation as formed by a particular people affects how the final "community"
is. We attempt to explore both the community nature of nations, and how said
nature changes with the ideological imagination of it.

# How are Nations Like Communities?

To understand the community aspect, we look at Benedict Anderson's proposed
'working definition' of a nation as an "imagined political community, imagined
as both inherently limited and sovereign". Why does he define the
nation in terms of community? It is observed in the modern nation that most 
people with nothing in common with each other - language, ethnicity, political
affiliation - who may never even meet, consider themselves to be connected in
some way due to sharing a nationality by chance of birth. Despite whatever
inequality exists, the nation is still conceived as a horizontal 'brotherhood',
a comradeship among equals. People go to war, potentially sacrificing themselves
for their 'brothers and sisters' of the community, that they will likely never
meet. It has some markings of a community, but it is not the traditional 
Gemeinschaft [^andersondef].

This begs comparison to the traditional imagining of a community. As discussed 
in the lecture, the key components of a Gemeinschaft are:

- social order based on *personal ties* (of 1000 or so at maximum)
- custom and tradition as the moral code
- family (birth) as the guiding force for social status and economic roles
- fulfillment at the cost of individual movement.

None of these apply to any nation of millions that for all intents and purposes
seems more aligned with Gesselschaft instead. But on closer examination, this
too does not match. There is a distinction between the nation and its call for a
sovereign state; social contract and mutual consent is shared among the citizens
and the state but not with the 'Nation' itself. So what is this community?
Ernest Gellner argues that "it (nationalism) *invents* nations where they do not
exist", taking pains to establish the 'falsity' of this community [^gellner].
Anderson opts to call it an 'imagined' community instead, noting that his peer's
statement implies the existence of 'true' communities of the scale to be
juxtaposed to nations, and also that all communities larger than primordial
villages with face-to-face contact are, in fact, imagined [^andersondef].

On that note, a good comparison to align the perspective of national community
to is the imagined community of religion. The community of strangers of the same
religious faith is driven by their common faith, the sacred (and equidistant)
language, a common 'fraternity'. It provides an ideological perspective similar
to that of nationalism, only the latter is in fact "intellectually poorer". We
need only look at Kohn's words in *The Nature of Nationalism*

> ... man's loyalty was due to his church or religion; a *heretic* put himself
out of the pale of society in the same way that a *"traitor"* to his nation
does today. [^kohnture]

# Is there a difference between the communities which are formed by civic and ethnic nationalism?

- yes
- ethnic and civic in theory, origins incl:
    - It is founded in a common principle of "liberty" and some unexplained belief
      that the nation is the ultimate source for the protection of these liberties.
      There is belief in a code here, the nation is a vessel. The belief is in the
      written law which is to serve a greater good, and not ethnicity. Not from an
      outward perspective, anyway.
    - Ethnic nationalism, on the other hand, is primarily externally motivated - a
      protest against an existing social structure. It is expanded by propaganda and
      education (however: France did this too!). And it relies on the image of an
      "ideal future" based on a non-existent "golden past"
- Current sit: all civic kinda, with naturalization laws. But looking at ethnic
  at constitution (israel, china) vs civic at constitution (usa)
    - maybe homogeneity meant ethnic didn't arise, but was brewing

## Points

- How are nations like Communities (Benedict Anderson):
    - Conceived as horizontal
    - Conception of a connect, even if most will never meet
    - Not exactly Gemeinschaft. There's millions, not thousands. There is
      individual movement, and family does not define social status, economic
      role, etc. We're still in Society, but we imagine there is a connection
      between random people we will never meet, cannot possibly ever meet,
      because we're born within the same arbitrary plot of land. Sometimes not
      even that.
    - Kohn - people consider themselves to be "of" a place, as opposed to "in" a
      place
- Answer: yes.
- First, what I mean by ethnic and civic. Using the definition of "by the
  constitution" and "by the ethnic nature", aka a limitation on religion, etc.
  Why? Because of countries like India, that would fall under "ethnic
  nationalism" as per Kohn, but is (still) Civic Nationalism in practice.

  Noting here that most nations seem to have some sort of naturalization
  process, but that does not always translate, like in China, hence these will
  be considered Ethnic.
  
  Basically, I'm not considering here the origin, but the current status of it,
  how it is considered.
- However, I will be using the original definitions by Kohn to motivate why
  civic and ethnic nationalisms are different.
- "Western nationalism" As Kohn calls it arises from the Englishman's need to
  have liberty. England, the first "new nation", Nationalism from the religious
  matrix, the self consideration of "new Israel". John Milton:
  
  > With him nationalism was not a struggle for collective independence from an 
  > “alien yoke”; it was the affirmation of individual freedom from authority, 
  > the self-assertion of personality is face of its own government or church, 
  > “the deliverance of man from the yoke of slavery and superstition.” Liberty 
  > to Milton was religious, political, and personal.

- India is a nation due to the political partition by the British? 
- Civic nationalism: Follow the Constitution and you're a national
- Ethnic nationalism: Be something
- Israel allows citizenship by return, descent, naturalization, etc.
  Exclusionary policy, and many have termed it as such, and UN creation marked
  it as "Jewish State". It also allows for nationals from the lands.
- Also, all Jewish people (as defined) can be Jewish nationals easily.
- Kuwaiti law requires one to be muslim. But there are no other restrictions on
  ethnicity per se.
- Bhutan has a strict citizenship law, immigration is based on parents/long
  servitude.
- There is an ethnic bleed into the Civic nationalisms
    - WASPs in America, the idea of immigrants not being American, especially if
      not white.
    - All nations seem to have a constitution allowing for naturalization
- There is a difference of sorts between communities of civic nationalism and
  communities of ethnic nationalism. Kinda. Now, most modern states have a
  constitution, but some are significantly more ethnic than others, while some
  display characteristics of wanting to be ethnic nationalist but are strictly
  civic till date
    - But america for example is a split community. Half want ethnic
      considerations? Does "white" count? It's a request for elimination of
      other ethnicities from the state. Others abide by the civic model.
- Han Chinese want to be more ethnic? Elimination of non-Han
- China considers all Hans to be chinese.
