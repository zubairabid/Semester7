**Question**: 
*How are nations like communities? Is there is a difference between 
the communities which are formed by civic and ethnic nationalisms?*

*(Write an essay (800-1200 words) explaining your answer. Draw on examples of at 
least two nations and nationalisms other than India.)*

# Introduction 

Most widely-accepted notions of nations today have a common grounding in
considering them to be *communities* of people: from Stalin and Seton-Watson's
definitions to Benedict Anderson's. But the manner of these people "coming 
together", as it were, also differs from one nation to another. The *conception*
of a nation as formed by a particular people affects how the final "community"
is. We attempt to explore both the community nature of nations, and how said
nature changes with the ideological imagination of it.

# How are Nations Like Communities?

## Communities as a horizontal brotherhood

To understand the community aspect, we look at Benedict Anderson's proposed
'working definition' of a nation as an "imagined political community, imagined
as both inherently limited and sovereign". Why does he define the
nation in terms of community? It is observed in the modern nation that most 
people with nothing in common with each other - language, ethnicity, political
affiliation - who may never even meet, consider themselves to be connected in
some way due to sharing a nationality by chance of birth. Despite whatever
inequality exists, the nation is still conceived as a horizontal 'brotherhood',
a comradeship among equals. People go to war, potentially sacrificing themselves
for their 'brothers and sisters' of the community, that they will likely never
meet. It has some markings of a community, but it is not the traditional 
Gemeinschaft [^andersondef].

## Nation in the framework of Gemeinschaft and Gesselschaft

This begs comparison to the traditional imagining of a community. As discussed 
in the lecture, the key components of a Gemeinschaft are:

- social order based on *personal ties* (of 1000 or so at maximum)
- custom and tradition as the moral code
- family (birth) as the guiding force for social status and economic roles
- fulfillment at the cost of individual movement.

None of these apply to any nation of millions that for all intents and purposes
seems more aligned with Gesselschaft instead. But on closer examination, this
too does not match. *There is a distinction between the nation and its call for 
a sovereign state*; social contract and mutual consent is shared among the 
citizens and the state but not with the 'Nation' itself. So what is this 
community? Ernest Gellner argues that "it (nationalism) *invents* nations where
they do not exist", taking pains to establish the 'falsity' of this community 
[^gellner].
Anderson opts to call it an 'imagined' community instead, noting that his peer's
statement implies the existence of 'true' communities of the scale to be
juxtaposed to nations, and also that all communities larger than primordial
villages with face-to-face contact are, in fact, imagined [^andersondef].

## A short correspondence between nationalism and religion

On that note, a good comparison to align the perspective of national community
to is the imagined community of religion. The community of strangers of the same
religious faith is driven by their common faith, the sacred (and equidistant)
language, a common 'fraternity'. It provides an ideological perspective similar
to that of nationalism, only the latter is in fact "intellectually poorer". We
need only look at Kohn's words in *The Nature of Nationalism*

> ... man's loyalty was due to his church or religion; a *heretic* put himself
out of the pale of society in the same way that a *"traitor" to his nation*
does today. [^kohnture]


# Is there a difference between the communities which are formed by civic and ethnic nationalism?

There is a difference. But it isn't black-and-white. Most sovereign nations today 
[^nations] appear to have some form of civic basis in their constitutions and 
laws for naturalized citizenship - mentioning, in some cases, the migrating
individual's national status too. Some founded on civic principles have shown
ethno-nationalist sentiments of late (eg: USA [^murica]). But a difference still 
exists for ethnically-*imagined* nations [^kunat] [^bhuci], be it in their 
incorporation as by constitution (think Israel [^israel]), or in the popular 
imagination of the residents (consider India).

A quick demonstration of why popular Indian imagination is ethnic - consider 
how the population deifies the achievements of non-citizens with any degree of 
Indian descent as an Indian achievement, despite the individual's own national
alignment which may not match this imagination. Or even in the behaviour towards
those who don't "look Indian".

## Theoretical differences distinguishing the two

Why should there be a difference?

It's in the imagination of a nation.
Hans Kohn talked of "western" (civic) and "eastern" (ethnic)
nationalisms [^kohnbook], and the motivations for each highlights the difference
in the imagination that forms aforementioned imagined communities.

**Civic nationalism** is based on principles of individual rights. The
State precedes the nation - the nation here is no clarion call for sovereignty
against an 'other', but rather a *structure that aids the exploration of
individual liberty*. Kohn examines this ideation through John Milton in Puritan
England:
  
> With him nationalism... 
> was the affirmation of individual freedom from authority, 
> the self-assertion of personality *in face of its own government or church*
[^kohnbookmil]

The nation is manifestation of a code, not a people. The community, others with
like-minded interests. At least in its conception, there is no ethnic limitation
imposed. Anyone with aligned goals can join the nation and further it.

**Ethnic nationalism**, on the other hand, "emerges as protests against existing
social structure". It's a call for sovereignty from an oppressor. The community
rallied around the cause of sovereignty can have arbitrary commonality, but
necessarily includes a supposed shared history, a 'glorious past' where the
community once was and must strive to return to through the efforts of
individual members. This community is thus limited.

With the theory behind us, we consider examples of each.

## Imaginations of ethnic nationalism in China, Israel, and more

Israel is the classic example of a nation with Ethnic roots - the UN resolution
announcing its creation refers to it as a "Jewish State" [^israel]. Such is 
prominently visible in its naturalization laws, where the **Law of Return** 
allows for citizenship to be conferred solely on Jewish ethnicity on three 
months of residence, opposed to three years required [^isapp] for regular 
naturalization.

China is another prominent nation that not only requires a common territorial 
history, but also ethnic. The Han form a majority in the nation - 91.6% in total
[^chicia] - and "Ethnicity and nationality have become almost interchangeable 
for China’s Han" [^ecochi]. Naturalisation is already a tough task, as despite
laws governing that permanent residents without familial connections can become
nationals [^chiimm], there are only 1448 naturalized citizens in the most
populated country in the world [^ecochi]. Adding to that is the consideration of
the Han as ethnically "pure", with minorities like the Uighurs sent to camps 
for not *being* this imagination of the nation [^chiui].

## Imaginations of the "civic" nations

In contrast we consider the United States of America. Arguably among the first
nations to be founded on the basis of principles:

> What held the new nation together was an idea, the idea of liberty under law
as expressed in the Constitution. [^kohnam]

The (non White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) view of American nationalism is civic. A
citizen is so due to their allegiance to the Constitution, and ethnicity plays
no role, leading to the nation's reputation as a "melting pot".

It so happens that this is *not* the only view of American nationalism
[^murica]. Reasonably popular imagination of the nation tends to make ethnic
restrictions on membership, and this is not unique to the United States (think
India again). Like
aforementioned, there's significant mish-mash of the two, and it remains to be
seen which branch will prevail at the end of it all.

## Points

- How are nations like Communities (Benedict Anderson):
    - Conceived as horizontal
    - Conception of a connect, even if most will never meet
    - Not exactly Gemeinschaft. There's millions, not thousands. There is
      individual movement, and family does not define social status, economic
      role, etc. We're still in Society, but we imagine there is a connection
      between random people we will never meet, cannot possibly ever meet,
      because we're born within the same arbitrary plot of land. Sometimes not
      even that.
    - Kohn - people consider themselves to be "of" a place, as opposed to "in" a
      place
- Answer: yes.
- First, what I mean by ethnic and civic. Using the definition of "by the
  constitution" and "by the ethnic nature", aka a limitation on religion, etc.
  Why? Because of countries like India, that would fall under "ethnic
  nationalism" as per Kohn, but is (still) Civic Nationalism in practice.

  Noting here that most nations seem to have some sort of naturalization
  process, but that does not always translate, like in China, hence these will
  be considered Ethnic.
  
  Basically, I'm not considering here the origin, but the current status of it,
  how it is considered.
- However, I will be using the original definitions by Kohn to motivate why
  civic and ethnic nationalisms are different.
- "Western nationalism" As Kohn calls it arises from the Englishman's need to
  have liberty. England, the first "new nation", Nationalism from the religious
  matrix, the self consideration of "new Israel". John Milton:
  
  > With him nationalism was not a struggle for collective independence from an 
  > “alien yoke”; it was the affirmation of individual freedom from authority, 
  > the self-assertion of personality is face of its own government or church, 
  > “the deliverance of man from the yoke of slavery and superstition.” Liberty 
  > to Milton was religious, political, and personal. 
  
  It is founded in a common principle of "liberty" and some unexplained belief
  that the nation is the ultimate source for the protection of these liberties.
  There is belief in a code here, the nation is a vessel. The belief is in the
  written law which is to serve a greater good, and not ethnicity. Not from an
  outward perspective, anyway.
- Ethnic nationalism, on the other hand, is primarily externally motivated - a
  protest against an existing social structure. It is expanded by propaganda and
  education (however: France did this too!). And it relies on the image of an
  "ideal future" based on a non-existent "golden past"





Random thoughts

- "Western nationalism" As Kohn calls it arises from the Englishman's need to
  have liberty. England, the first "new nation", Nationalism from the religious
  matrix, the self consideration of "new Israel". John Milton:
  
- Ethnic nationalism, on the other hand, is primarily externally motivated - a
  protest against an existing social structure. It is expanded by propaganda and
  education (however: France did this too!). And it relies on the image of an
  "ideal future" based on a non-existent "golden past"

- India is a nation due to the political partition by the British? 
- Civic nationalism: Follow the Constitution and you're a national
- Ethnic nationalism: Be something
- Israel allows citizenship by return, descent, naturalization, etc.
  Exclusionary policy, and many have termed it as such, and UN creation marked
  it as "Jewish State". It also allows for nationals from the lands.
- Also, all Jewish people (as defined) can be Jewish nationals easily.
- Kuwaiti law requires one to be muslim. But there are no other restrictions on
  ethnicity per se.
- Bhutan has a strict citizenship law, immigration is based on parents/long
  servitude.
- There is an ethnic bleed into the Civic nationalisms
    - WASPs in America, the idea of immigrants not being American, especially if
      not white.
    - All nations seem to have a constitution allowing for naturalization
- There is a difference of sorts between communities of civic nationalism and
  communities of ethnic nationalism. Kinda. Now, most modern states have a
  constitution, but some are significantly more ethnic than others, while some
  display characteristics of wanting to be ethnic nationalist but are strictly
  civic till date
    - But america for example is a split community. Half want ethnic
      considerations? Does "white" count? It's a request for elimination of
      other ethnicities from the state. Others abide by the civic model.
- Han Chinese want to be more ethnic? Elimination of non-Han
- China considers all Hans to be chinese.

[^nations]: Based on a brief survey, all states allow some form of
naturalization in order to be a citizen of the country, with some of them
specifying nationality as well. However, it isn't as "easy" for some if the
to-be immigrant has no familial connection to the State. Bhutan requires 30
years of residency with no record of remonstrances against the government, 
Kuwait requires 20 years along with the requirement of being a Muslim.
Israel and China too, although we will be discussing those at length 
later.
