**Question**: 
*How are nations like communities? Is there is a difference between 
the communities which are formed by civic and ethnic nationalisms?*

*(Write an essay (800-1200 words) explaining your answer. Draw on examples of at 
least two nations and nationalisms other than India.)*

## Points

- How are nations like Communities (Benedict Anderson):
    - Conceived as horizontal
    - Conception of a connect, even if most will never meet
    - Not exactly Gemeinschaft. There's millions, not thousands. There is
      individual movement, and family does not define social status, economic
      role, etc. We're still in Society, but we imagine there is a connection
      between random people we will never meet, cannot possibly ever meet,
      because we're born within the same arbitrary plot of land. Sometimes not
      even that.
    - Kohn - people consider themselves to be "of" a place, as opposed to "in" a
      place
