1. The United States of America and Canada are both countries which can be 
   classified as Civic Nationalist, where both have their origin in the same 
   context: British Colonialism and White Settler (Creole) Nationalism. 
   Similarly, Pakistan and Bangladesh can both be classified as Ethnic 
   Nationalist countries, with both having a similar origin in British Indian 
   colonialism and foregrounding religion and language as nationalist markers.
   Why did the USA and Canada emerge as distinct nations, just as why did 
   Pakistan and Bangladesh appear as different nations, despite similar origins?
   Can the theories of civic and ethnic nationalism explain them? What about the
   insights provided by E.H. Carr? Finally, which particular aspect of Benedict
   Andersonâ€™s theory explains this distinction/division between these pairs?
2. Which of these two ideas take explanatory primacy in explaining the rise of 
   official and colonial nationalisms: the concept of bounded, border contained
   journeys, or the idea of print-capitalism combined with school education?

Note: Please use the internet to get information about the countries, examples 
used. However, please provide clear references.
