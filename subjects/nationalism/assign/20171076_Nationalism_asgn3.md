# Introduction

This essay attempts to detail the concept of 'invented traditions', and how
their *alterative nature* is a key feature in shaping nationalist movements as a
way to gather mass support. It is primarily based on Hobsbawm and Ranger's 'The
Invention of Tradition' [-@hobsbawm_invention_2012].

# What is Invented Tradition?

Invented traditions are traditions [^trad] that are perceived as, or claimed to 
be, ancient - but are in fact new(er than people assume them to be); often 
intentional political creations. British Royal Ceremonies, for instance. They
may also arise naturally through regular practice or chance over time, such as
the adoption of 'chai' in India due to inability to sell tea overseas
during the First World War. It is unclear on the details of how invented 
traditions come into
being due to a lack of a detailed study in the direction [^ho_tradintconf], but
generally speaking they can be created either through political directive, or
just come into being due to regular practice of certain customs among people
[^customdisc].

A key point to take from the concept is that to the layperson, invented
traditions are just traditions. And just as traditions enable an imagination of 
the past; invented traditions - accidental or otherwise - replace that with
their own version of reality. This will be a central concept for understanding
the links to nationalism, and we define it
here as the *alterative nature* of invented traditions.

Invented traditions also differ from traditional ones by other metrics - they
tend to be far more vague and unspecified as to the nature of the values they
inculcate - 'patriotism', 'loyalty', 'the school spirit', and the like, while
simultaneously being very strictly adhered to in practice, such as
the requirement to stand up for the National Anthem. In addition, they seem to
have only filled in the space of older traditions in people's public spaces, and
not their private ones [^ho_invdiff].

Hobsbawm observes three overlapping types of invented tradition [^ho_types]:

- Those establishing/symbolizing social cohesion or group membership in real
  or artificial communities
- Those establishing/legitimizing institutions/status/relations of
  authority
- Those with the purpose of socialization, and the inculcation of beliefs,
  value systems, and conventions of behaviour

## The interplay of Tradition with Customs

- Customs aren't tradition. Here's how: not just ideological, can change for
  bureaucratic efficiency, are not assumed invariant unlike traditions.
- Customs used to give sanction of precedence
- Customs come by repeated practice, and it affects tradition

# Invention of Tradition for Continuity

- Kind of an extension of Tradition, but plays heavily into how it's useful for
  nationalism, so setting this as a middle ground for both answers.
- All invented traditions can be used to establish continuity with *some*
  suitable historic pasts. Including those built on revolutions, or progressive
  movements. The history does not need to be real; it's often embellished
  [^ho_trcont]
- This allows invented traditions claiming links to a distant, superior past to
  be accorded the status of 'symbols of invariance' in times of drastic social
  change [^syminvar]. "Soften the impact of novelty by dressing it up as
  antiquity" [^cl_nov]
- Not to be mocked, as showing ideological importance of perception
  [@buchanan_dictionary_2018]
- This nature means all societies use it, even modern ones. They can adopt other
  histories, stretch them, make up their own.
- Even with explicit gaps in the continuity, these are espoused.

# In Brief: The link between Invented Tradition and Nationalism

- Hobsbawm's theory of nations aligning with Gellner - "Nationalism is a
  political principle, which holds that the political and national unit should
  be congruent" [@gellner_nations_1983, pp. 1]

- Get people cool with the idea of a nation
- Masses play a big part in this
- More than IT, but focus
- Lots of ITs for justifying consolidation of power
- Can look at it as introducing Gemeinschaft
- Also helps spread nationalism further

# Overview of ideas

- Some explanation on "Invented tradition" in itself. My definition, how it
  is created, what "invented" changes, types of invented traditions
- Elaborating slightly more to emphasise the point: On the interplay of
  tradition with customs as a prelude to Invention for Continuity
- Now, Invention for Continuity: still about Invented traditions, but is in
  direct relation to how it links to nationalism and the nation state.
- The central link: Hobsbawm's views on nationalism as constructed from above,
  and how continuity enables the people to follow that line.
- Demonstrating said link with the Invented Traditions of various nations, and
  the circumstances they arise in:
    - France as a model of general national symbolism, and minimization of
      history
    - German as a model of unification against some 'enemy'
    - The United States as a model of expressing nationalism in a heterogeneous
      immigrant-heavy environment

# Outline

- What invented traditions are:
    - Invented traditions are traditions that are claimed to be old, or are 
      perceived as old, but are in fact new(er than people assume them to be).
      They have supposed links to actions of the past, even if there were none.
    - Invented traditions are either intentionally created through political
      directive, or originate organically over time through regular practice of
      certain customs among people.
    - It is not entirely clear how Traditions are invented, either intentional
      or [organic](organic), as it has not been studied in too much detail. 
      [@hobsbawm_invention_2012, pp. 4]
    - Difference from old tradition: vague construction, strict adherence.
- Three types of:
    - Those establishing/symbolizing social cohesion or group membership in real
      or artificial communities
    - Those establishing/legitimizing institutions/status/relations of
      authority
    - Those with the purpose of socialization, and the inculcation of beliefs,
      value systems, and conventions of behaviour
- Quickly, traditions vs customs:
    - Customs are not tradition, although it is linked to tradition - the
      decline of a custom changes the tradition around it. How a lawyer's wig is
      not a matter of 'tradition' until it is no longer customary to wear a wig.
    - Customs come by repeated practice. The reason for their existence is often
      practical and not ideological, existing for bureaucratic efficiency, which
      can be changed as practically seen fit. In Marxist terms, they belong to
      the "base" and not the "superstructure" [@hobsbawm_invention_2012, pp. 3]
    - "Customs" are used often to give the sanction of precedence and social
      continuity to demands for protection and defence of practices 
      [@hobsbawm_invention_2012, pp. 2]. This plays into a key feature of
      Invented Traditions.
- The value of Invented Tradition in Continuity
    - A key feature is that Invented traditions are often used to establish
      continuity with some *suitable* historic past. Even for invented 
      traditions
      built on revolutions/progressive movements, there is some historic past 
      that is (has to be) constructed for acceptance (elaborated later). This 
      historic past does not need to be real, and is almost always embellished. 
      [@hobsbawm_invention_2012, pp. 7]. This is something we will see often
      with its usage in nations.
    - This allows invented traditions to be held as symbols of "invariance" in 
      times of rapid change in social patterns - establishing "time immemorial
      customs" that can, as we saw earlier, give the sanction of precedence and 
      legitimize change in the eyes of masses. Nominal continuities that have a
      major impact.
    - "Hobsbawm's point, however, is not to mock such fictions, but to highlight 
      the ideological importance of at least the perception of continuity with 
      the past." [@buchanan_dictionary_2018]
    - The use of Invented Traditions for such reasons is not limited to
      "traditional" societies alone, but also extends to "modern ones".
      Traditions are also given up, not due to need, but by intention.
    - How traditions can be invented - parties can make their own ones, co-opt
      existing traditions in a new light, or rework older traditions outside the
      boundary of their original imagination. They can even be completely made
      up. 
    - Sometimes, these invented traditions - even those espoused by self-defined
      'traditionalists' - have a clear break in continuity.

- Hobsbawm's theory of the nation aligns with Gellner's.
- The Nation preludes the Nation-State. 
- Small group of pioneers, intellectuals are politically motivated about the
  existence of a state, for whatever reason. Nation has been constructed from
  above.
- Need to get the masses in the picture too. The new state needs to justify its
  legitimacy as a ruler (especially when no suffrage). National identification
  of the people of the state as "of the nation" can't be forced from above with
  ideological arguments, do not assume the rational calculation of Individual
  members. Invented traditions can fake a past. Give abstract markers to shout
  for without any clear definition on what they are.
- Invented traditions aren't all, but focusing on only that. Also they don't
  guarantee success for the inventor, but the nation lived on.
- Lot of the construction thus is to justify consolidation of political power by
  classing under "nations". Requires the linking of National, Political, Social.
- Essentially, introducing Gemeinschaft into the Industrial society, status into
  a world of contract, normalising the change for people.
- Also used for spreading nationalism, of course.

# General Points

- What are Invented tradition:
    - Commonly, claim to be old/are perceived as old but are actually new
    - Can be invented, either intentionally or organically
    - Symbolic use as traditions once no longer practical
- Tradition vs Custom:
    - Traditions come from custom
    - Tradition seems invariant, but depends on custom. Which is variant
    - Consider the customs of a conservative regimented army vs traditions of
      big game hunters
- Invented tradition for Continuity - intro to nationalist uses:
    - All the time, there is a past for continuity. It is factitious
    - Invention as a thing accompanying any change in society. Tradition used 
      for invariance
    - Can make their own, co-opt, or expand
- ...

- Nationalism of the few preludes the Nation-State, 'from above'. Invented
  traditions do not guarantee, but provide some support for, convincing the view
  from below.
- Invented Tradition and Nationalism:
    - Nationalism gets its history wrong to create the Nation.
    - This requires linking of National, Political, Social. Once that is done,
      nationalists can make use of Invented Traditions to:
        - bring Gemeinschaft into Industrial society, normalising it for people.
        - "make nationalists" through propaganda embedded into new institutions
          and systems. "peasants into frenchmen"
    - New traditions are dressed up with the garb of "ancient links".
    - French - alternate civic religion:
        - Secular eq of the church, education for creating masses
        - Public-facing ceremonies, Expression of state power and pomp
        - Public monuments mass-produced as symbols - Marianne.
    - Imagery sans history:
        - Tricolour
        - Monogram
        - Motto
        - Marseillaise
        - Marianne, statues
        - Bastille Day
    - French: non-historic imagery. Nation constructed by education and
      utilising love for the Revolution.
    - German: only commonality as being unified; extensive "historic" imagery.
      Nation constructed as in opposition to an "other"
    - USA: propaganda for americanising immigrants
    - India:
        - Nagari script
        - Cultural: Chai, Paneer, Sweets
        - Celebration of religions:
            - Ganesh Chaturthi
            - Durga Puja
            - Santoshi Mata
        - From French Marianne: Bharat Mata
        - From French Flag: National Flag
        - From British: National Anthem

[^trad]: As for what is tradition? That is outside the scope of this essay,
although we can refer to @shils_tradition_1981 [pp. 12-13] for a brief summary.
Broadly, we use it here as "that which is handed down - includes ... beliefs
about all sorts of things ...". The idea is that tradition allows people a
connection to the past so to speak, thus giving them a view of what the past
would have been like as described by said tradition.

[^ho_tradintconf]: See @hobsbawm_invention_2012 [pp. 4]

[^customdisc]: Customs are not the same as tradition. We elaborate on this soon.

[^ho_invdiff]: See @hobsbawm_invention_2012 [pp. 10-11]

[^ho_types]: See @hobsbawm_invention_2012 [pp. 9]

[^ho_trcont]: @hobsbawm_invention_2012 [pp. 7] mentions a few examples of
embellished or straight-up falsified "histories" used to further national
interests, such as the Czech medieval manuscripts

[^syminvar]: We have already spoke of tradition as shaping
views of the past. It is taken as justification for
future actions. An invented tradition then, posits a synthetic reality of the
past. This link to the past gives an action the sanction of precedence and
legitimizes its acceptance. It allows revolutionaries to claim their desired
future was the default since time immemorial, usurped only in recent memory by
the vile parasites currently in control - earning sympathy, and often support.
