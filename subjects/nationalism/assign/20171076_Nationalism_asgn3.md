# Introduction

This essay attempts to detail the concept of 'invented traditions', and how
their *alterative nature* is a key feature in shaping nationalist movements as a
way to gather mass support. It is primarily based on Hobsbawm and Ranger's 'The
Invention of Tradition' [-@hobsbawm_invention_1992]. I focus entirely on
Politically invented traditions, as social ones come about from the existing
community of the nation, and not the prospective one.

# What is Invented Tradition?

Invented traditions are traditions [^trad] that are perceived as, or claimed to 
be, ancient - but are in fact new(er than people assume them to be); often 
intentional political creations. British Royal Ceremonies, for instance. They
may also arise naturally through regular practice or chance over time, such as
the adoption of 'chai' in India due to inability to sell tea overseas
during the First World War. It is unclear on the details of how invented 
traditions come into
being due to a lack of a detailed study in the direction [^ho_tradintconf], but
generally speaking they can be created either through political directive, or
just come into being due to regular practice of certain customs among people
[^customdisc].

A key point to take from the concept is that to the layperson, invented
traditions are just traditions. And just as traditions enable an imagination of 
the past; invented traditions - accidental or otherwise - replace that with
their own version of reality. This will be a central concept for understanding
the links to nationalism, and we define it
here as the *alterative nature* of invented traditions.

Invented traditions also differ from traditional ones by other metrics - they
tend to be far more vague and unspecified as to the nature of the values they
inculcate - 'patriotism', 'loyalty', 'the school spirit', and the like, while
simultaneously being very strictly adhered to in practice, such as
the requirement to stand up for the National Anthem. In addition, they seem to
have only filled in the space of older traditions in people's public spaces, and
not their private ones [^ho_invdiff].

Hobsbawm observes three overlapping types of invented tradition [^ho_types]:

- Those establishing/symbolizing social cohesion or group membership in real
  or artificial communities
- Those establishing/legitimizing institutions/status/relations of
  authority
- Those with the purpose of socialization, and the inculcation of beliefs,
  value systems, and conventions of behaviour

## The interplay of Tradition with Customs

Before we proceed, customs aren't traditions. They're linked, and the
disappearance of customs changes long-standing traditions, but it isn't an
equivalence. This is because we define custom as any regular behaviour brought
about by invariant regular action. Unlike tradition their reason is practical,
not ideological. They can change to maximise bureaucratic efficiency - consider
how the relatively conservative army will change their uniform for practical
benefit, but the tradition-dipped hunter will not change what they wear during
hunting season [^ho_cust]. The distinction isn't arbitrary - customs, unlike
traditions, are not assumed invariant. So custom becomes practice, and tradition
legacy.

With that said, customs are often used to give the sanction of precedence and
social continuity for demands of protection and defence of practices [^ho_sanc].
A group of weavers can claim benefits to maintain their 'custom', which could be
just the best practices that have come up amongst themselves to weave cloth, but
backed with the authority of continuity. It is not difficult to draw a
comparison from here to the role of Invented Tradition.

# Invention of Tradition for Continuity

This section technically falls within the purview of describing invented
tradition, but it is central to how invented tradition is useful for
nationalism, so we will examine it as a transitional topic.

*All* invented traditions have a history, and can be used to establish continuity
with the past, if suitable. This history does not need to be real; in fact it
is often embellished [^ho_trcont]. This allows agents of drastic social change
to accord the status of 'symbols of invariance' to certain invented traditions
of their choosing, that claim links to a distant, better past, to "soften the
impact of novelty by dressing it up as antiquity" [^syminvar] [^cl_nov]. Using
the apparent continuity of tradition to legitimize change in the eyes of
masses.

And all societies make use of invented traditions - even 'modern' ones. Using it
isn't hard, per se - interested parties can simply co-opt existing traditions,
or create new ones, or twist older ones to beyond recognition but with the same
garb. Interestingly, even when there are explicit gaps in the continuity, the
new tradition is espoused by all, often most vehemently by self-declared
'traditionalists'. The mass acceptance of new tradition under the garb of nominal
continuity is not really rational, but as rulers in the 1870s learnt,
'irrational' elements were necessary for the maintenance of the social fabric
[^ho_rat].

# In Brief: The link between Invented Tradition and Nationalism

Hobsbawm's theory of nations aligned with that of Gellner - "Nationalism is a
political principle, which holds that the political and national unit should
be congruent" [@gellner_nations_1983, pp. 1]. It is this foundation that drives
the rest of his theory.

His theory posits that national feelings develop unevenly across societal
borders. Nationalists come first, and then the Nation, and then the masses are
to be convinced that they are part of this Nation. So, the idea of a nation comes 
as a 'from above' approach that 
needs to be spread across to the sub-literary level to be effective.
Essentially, the wants of the popular masses plays a large role - and the
nationalists. Invented traditions come to the rescue here - as Nationalism gets
"it's history wrong" in order to appeal to the masses and form the "history of
the Nation" a posteriori [^moreit].

We can look at invented tradition in the realm of Nationalism as introducing
Gemeinschaft in an Industrial society, to normalise such among the people.

Invented tradition was also used to further the cause of the nation and
nationalists. We move on to some specific demonstrations across several Nations.

# Demonstrating invented traditions of Nations

To properly demonstrate invented traditions for purposes of Nationalism, 
we will be looking at invented traditions in three countries, paying attention
to different elements in each as the "challenges" the tradition had to overcome
differed by nation. We will also bring in some Indian examples at times.

## The French: Nationalism with minimal history with symbolism

The French are rather notable, in that their Invented tradition involves little
history [^frhist], and so the symbols utilised by them lend themselves to a more
general meaning for piracy. They introduced three major inventions of tradition:

1. *Primary Education* as a secular substitute for the Church. The primary
   education provided by the State was also ripe in revolutionary and republican
   principles and content, so not only would the peasants become Frenchmen, but
   good Republicans too.
2. *Public Ceremonies* for an expression of state pomp and power for the
   citizen's pleasure. [^gerfr]
3. *Monuments* of some representation of France - be it Marianne, or whatever
   local bearded hero a district chose, constructed in all scales across the
   country.

Apart from these they provide a lot of the general imagery we associate with
Nations today - a tricolour flag (inspiring most countries' flags, and raised in
Calcutta in the 1800s), a motto, a symbol in the form of
personification (think Bharat Mata) [^frmore].

## [The](The) Germans: Aggrandizing history

German tried to establish continuity from the First Reich to the Second, and
stress on how Prussia was historically linked to Germany. But fitting the
history would not work, German Roman-Catholic history didn't go in any mould.
So, two "traditions" were created:

1. Germany had emerged struggling against a secular enemy
2. The German nation scattered around Europe could claim the right to be
   united as a State.
      
The synthesis meant that there was always an enemy for the Germans, and this
was reflected throughout the imagery. Consider the symbol of the country: 
*Deutsche Michel*. Meant to show the
simplicity of the German people that was exploited by the foreigners. 

Apart from
Bismarckian unification, most Germans did not share any common identity, so
compared to France, the definition of the German Nation was far more
complicated, and much less precise. 
 Germany the nation was better defined in
terms of what it was against - including, often, internal enemies.

## The United States: Identity in the face of mass immigration

The United States were faced with a unique problem: assimilating a heterogeneous
mass of immigrants, how would they *make* Americans those who were outsiders?

It lead to what we see today as a mass of traditions, all considered "American".
Immigrants were encouraged to accept "American" rituals, like the Revolution and
it's founding fathers and the 4th of July, along with Protestant Anglo-Saxon
Traditions like Thanksgiving Day. Likewise, Immigrant culture was absorbed -
St. Patrick's Day, Columbus Day.
Other rituals grew, again, around the education system for political
socialization. The Worship of the American flag, for instance. [^usen]

# Invented Traditions that did not come under a Nationalist Banner

I will simply list them, as there is not much to say.

## Traditions that have failed

- Defining King William I as the "father of Germany"

## Traditions that aren't Nationalist

- May Day
- Daughters of American Revolution
- Level of education as marker of class
- Greek Letter Fraternities as marker of elite among the mass
- Alumni Societies of Schools for the elite, and Fraternities
- Elite among colleges: playing sports

[^trad]: As for what is tradition? That is outside the scope of this essay,
although we can refer to @shils_tradition_1981 [pp. 12-13] for a brief summary.
Broadly, we use it here as "that which is handed down - includes ... beliefs
about all sorts of things ...". The idea is that tradition allows people a
connection to the past so to speak, thus giving them a view of what the past
would have been like as described by said tradition.

embellished or straight-up falsified "histories" used to further national
interests, such as the Czech medieval manuscripts

[^syminvar]: We have already spoke of tradition as shaping
views of the past. It is taken as justification for
future actions. An invented tradition then, posits a synthetic reality of the
past. This link to the past gives an action the sanction of precedence and
legitimizes its acceptance. It allows revolutionaries to claim that their desired
future was the default since time immemorial, usurped only in recent memory by
the vile parasites currently in control - earning sympathy, and often support.

a Nation smoothly. There are extensive politics involved, and you can check

[^gerfr]: Where the French only had one event, however, the Germans had as
many as ten in the gap of seven months in a single year
[@hobsbawm_invention_1992, pp. 277]

[^frmore]: There's other symbols/traditions too, like
*Le Marseillaise* (although the concept of the National Anthem was first covered
by Britain), the Republican Monogram.

[^usen]: Like with Germany, there was an internal enemy here too - Immigrants, 
especially working class.
