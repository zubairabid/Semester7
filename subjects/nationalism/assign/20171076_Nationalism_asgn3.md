**Question**:

traditions which have become a part of national cultures, and some invented 
traditions which have not.**

- What invented traditions are:
    - Invented traditions are traditions that are claimed to be old, or are 
      perceived as old, but are in fact new(er than people assume them to be).
      They have supposed links to actions of the past, even if there were none.
    - Invented traditions are either intentionally created through political
      directive, or originate organically over time through regular practice of
      certain customs among people.
    - It is not entirely clear how Traditions are invented, either intentional
      or organic, as it has not been studied in too much detail. 
      [@hobsbawm_invention_2012, pp. 4]
- Quickly, traditions vs customs:
    - Customs are not tradition, although it is linked to tradition - the
      decline of a custom changes the tradition around it. How a lawyer's wig is
      not a matter of 'tradition' until it is no longer customary to wear a wig.
    - Customs come by repeated practice. The reason for their existence is often
      practical and not ideological, existing for bureaucratic efficiency, which
      can be changed as practically seen fit. In Marxist terms, they belong to
      the "base" and not the "superstructure" [@hobsbawm_invention_2012, pp. 3]
    - "Customs" are used often to give the sanction of precedence and social
      continuity to demands for protection and defence of practices 
      [@hobsbawm_invention_2012, pp. 2]. This plays into a key feature of
      Invented Traditions.
- The value of Invented Tradition in Continuity
    - A key feature is that Invented traditions are often used to establish
      continuity with some *suitable* historic past. Even for invented 
      traditions
      built on revolutions/progressive movements, there is some historic past 
      that is (has to be) constructed for acceptance (elaborated later). This 
      historic past does not need to be real, and is almost always embellished. 
      [@hobsbawm_invention_2012, pp. 7]. This is something we will see often
      with its usage in nations.
    - This allows invented traditions to be held as symbols of "invariance" in 
      times of rapid change in social patterns - establishing "time immemorial
      customs" that can, as we saw earlier, give the sanction of precedence and 
      legitimize change in the eyes of masses.
    - "Hobsbawm's point, however, is not to mock such fictions, but to highlight 
      the ideological importance of at least the perception of continuity with 
      the past." [@buchanan_dictionary_2018]
    - The use of Invented Traditions for such reasons is not limited to
      "traditional" societies alone, but also extends to "modern ones".
      Traditions are also given up, not due to need, but by intention.
    - How traditions can be invented - parties can make their own ones, co-opt
      existing traditions in a new light, or rework older traditions outside the
      boundary of their original imagination. They can even be completely made
      up. 
    - Sometimes, these invented traditions - even those espoused by self-defined
      'traditionalists' - have a clear break in continuity.
- Three types of:
    - Those establishing/symbolizing social cohesion or group membership in real
      or artificial communities
    - Those establishing/legitimizing institutions/status/relations of
      authority
    - Those with the purpose of socialization, and the inculcation of beliefs,
      value systems, and conventions of behaviour


- What are Invented tradition:
    - Commonly, claim to be old/are perceived as old but are actually new
    - Can be invented, either intentionally or organically
    - Symbolic use as traditions once no longer practical
- Tradition vs Custom:
    - Traditions come from custom
    - Tradition seems invariant, but depends on custom. Which is variant
    - Consider the customs of a conservative regimented army vs traditions of
      big game hunters
- Invented tradition for Continuity - intro to nationalist uses:
    - All the time, there is a past for continuity. It is factitious
    - Invention as a thing accompanying any change in society. Tradition used 
      for invariance
    - Can make their own, co-opt, or expand
- ...

- Invented Tradition and Nationalism:
    - Nationalism getting its history wrong
    - Requires linking of National, Political, Social
    - Bring aspects of Gemeinschaft to modern society
    - European Examples:
        - New rules have to be put for social change
