# 1: Introduction

- Current conflicts between Marxist nations have no class conflict inherent in
  them, and are instead based on national terms.
- Nations aren't necessarily set in stone, many are breaking off newly.
- **Paradoxes of Nationalism**:
    - objective modernity vs subjective antiquity
    - absolute universality vs irredeemable particularity
    - political power vs philosophical poverty/incoherence
- More like a religion
- **Proposed definition**:
    - *Imagined community*:
        - Most people will never interact
        - Gellner says nations are invented, but they're imagined, not "false".
    - *(Imagined as) Inherently limited and Sovereign*:
        - There must be an other
        - Unlike religion, which seeks to encompass and be universally
          applicable to all
    - *Community?*:
        - Conceived as horizontal, despite all differences
        - Allows people to die for the abstract nation

# 2: Cultural Roots

- All religions have answers for the metaphysical - why do people die, why is
  someone blind, the concept of a continuity.
- Evolutionary/progressive styles of thinking answer these with stoic silence,
  "do not know". Marxism included.
- The idea of Nationalism turns chance to magical destiny.
- Not a suggestion that Nationalism superseded religion, but that the phenomenon
  can be understood by aligning it against largely held cultural beliefs, and
  not self-consciously held political beliefs.
- Consider religious communities:
    - Vast territorial reaches, imaginable only through a sacred language and
      written script that is far removed from all those involved.
    - Distinct difference from modern imagined community: confidence in the
      sacredness of the language, hence allowing for incorporation via learning
      the sacred script. Han behaviour towards "barbarians", Colombian liberal
      on "extinguishing (American) Indians" by giving property, inter-marriage,
      as opposed to straight up genocide.
    - Still, *the language is only known to a select few*. Centripetal society
      with only the clergy/top religious leaders having the power to translate
      the divine language to the common tongue.
    - How did the religious communities break up into incoherence over time? Two
      things:
        - Exploration of other (non-European?) worlds, expanding cultural
          horizon. *Marco Polo* writes about the Khan, assigning soft
          territorial limits to his imaginings of religion. *Rica* 4 centuries
          later, does it intentionally. 
        - The demotion of the sacred language, as a result of the explosion of
          vernacular and expanded education. Highly probably a result of Print
          Capitalism.
- Consider Dynasties:
    - Kinship based on a centre, legitimized not through the power of the people
      but through 'divine will'. No contesting it, if you're under the ambit of
      it. Expanded through warfare and sexual politics.
    - This power starts waning in the 16th century. Dynasties happen to be the
      primary till the early 20th century, but near the end you can see them,
      too, reaching into "national consciousness" to legitimize their rule.
- Consider the imagination of time and culture. Messianic time â‰  Modern time.
  Simultaneity-along-time vs Homogeneous, empty, common time.
- We can consider a *social organism moving through homogeneous time*, like the
  characters in a contemporary novel that never interact, but do their work and
  we know, as the omnipotent reader, their relation to society. It isn't the
  narration of events among heroes of the epics. The reader in the contemporary
  novel might draw analogue to their own real world, the situation may be placed
  such by the author. The old one, the story is flashbacks in a conversation.
  The modern one has the hero in detail, but not specific - a nationalist story
  can generalise to *any* such person, a symbol rather than a person, invoking
  the full spirit of the imagined community.
