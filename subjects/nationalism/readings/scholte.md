Notes on select portions of [Globalization]

# Chapter 1: Globalization Debates

- Globalization is contested heavily

# Chapter 2: Defining Globalization

- Old definitions are invalid
- New social understanding

Self notes:

- Supraterritorial is about the social connection, and people are global in that
  sense, 
 
  Crit: but a lot of people have not left their village/town/city/state/country
  and don't interact on the internet enough for personal social connections.
  Most people have access to other media, but it's still an "other". Cheering
  for the Olympics, yes, but cheering for your own country.

- Possible approach: Globalization is a geographical trend (p. 83), but needs
  political motivation to push it through. And it is most often locally applied.
  Assuming nations remain strong, they are more likely to push their vision of
  it than the one defined.
  
# Chapter 3: Globalization in History
