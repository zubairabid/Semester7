- contents
{:toc}

# Chapter 1: Globalization Debates

- Globalization is contested heavily

# Chapter 2: Defining Globalization

- Old definitions are invalid
- New social understanding

Self notes:

- Supraterritorial is about the social connection, and people are global in that
  sense, but a lot of people have not left their village/town/city/state/country
  and don't interact on the internet enough for personal social connections.
  Most people have access to other media, but it's still an "other". Cheering
  for the Olympics, yes, but cheering for your own country.

# Chapter 3: Globalization in History

# Chapter 4: Explaining Globalization
