**Place in descending order the three paradoxes based on how well Benedict
Anderson manages to explain them in his book**
 
**Ans**: In order[^note],

1. *Political power of nationalism v/s Philosophical poverty/incoherence* 
   
   Attempting to rationalise nationalism's reach is a big part of the book
   written in the 1980s - in itself indicative of the philosophical poverty of
   the concept. By drawing comparisons to religious popularity and pointing at
   the various phases of nationalism that include language commonalities, the
   idea of a "shared journey", and vernacular print capitalism, he also explains
   the political power of the phenomenon rather well (the idea of Nationalism 
   turns chance to magical destiny in the void left by the weakening of
   religion).
2. *Objective modernity of nations v/s Subjective antiquity in the eyes of
   nationalists* 
   
   Another paradox that Anderson explains almost as well: in terms of our modern
   perceptions of space and time. For nationalists, events of the pasts are the
   actions of people living in the same imagination of time as them, and within
   the same borders of the modern nation that are retroactively applied onto
   them. It makes it easier to imagine their actions as the actions of a shared
   community that has continuous presence into modern day as a nation.
3. *Universal as a socio-cultural concept v/s Irremediable particularity of its
   concrete manifestations* 
   
   Anderson does not go much into detail on how the universality of nationalism
   is contradictory to that of other universal constructs like gender - he
   mentions that, like gender, everyone "has" a nationality, but does not
   elaborate into why it's irremediably particular beyond what is self-evident
   from observation of modern nations.
