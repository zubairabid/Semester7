# Theory of nationalism for India

- Non-existence of idea of "national"?
- Equivalence of national and citizen

I like Hobsbawm's theories on Invented Tradition, as it's widespread in
justifying nationalism in India currently:

- Chai as a culture
- Durga Puja/Ganesh Chaturthi
- Shyam's DHP on ITs in India (GI tags ones)

Aspects of Gellner:

- Many potential nationalisms, actualised as states

## Questions

- Nationalism in India today = popular sentiment? What judges have said? Isn't
  most legal discourse around Citizenship, so will that come into the picture?

# Globalisation's triumph?
