# Globalisation's triumph?

## Very vague outlining

- Globalisation is not dead
    - Even though some economic arguments claim is
    - Define it, and give examples where you agree (5 definitions, cases against
      or for each in brief)
    - General agreement with the book, and mention how *this will all factor in*
    - Overall: summarise the book. 600 words.
- Why would people herald the death of the nation-state?
    - There's the whole globalisation OP not-fad respatialization thing. Global
      village, Economic liberation, yada yada.
    - Globalisation != Internationalisation, does not necessitate nations.
    - The internet eased communication in unreal, unexpected fashion. Two-way
      communication. State seemingly does not control this dimension. Most
      arguments were from earlier.
    - Gellner did say Nationalism was a weak force, a well tended garden
    - Scholte says the State remains, but its character shifts. Possible
      over-appeasement (but perhaps not to democratic globalisation)?
    - Bemyeh. Will get to responses to him later.
- Looking at history of nationalism, comparing against globalisation and
  viability:
    - Anderson's Imagined Community: No other
    - Kohn's Replacement for God: No cause
    - Gellner's Nationalism came first (so I don't forget: in Gellner's chicken
      and egg problem, the egg came first)
    - Hobsbawm's Invented Tradition: Maybe but how?
    - (Maybe) De-universalisation of literate high culture (in new shape)?
    - (Maybe) Alike to the "Colonial Indian Elite"? Football idea.
- How information-mediation may actually help nationalism:
    - Already exists a long-distance nationalism (Anderson)
    - Becomes worse with the internet (Eriksen, Conversi)
- Also other theories, that I cannot back as strongly, leaning towards...
    - Not viable due to violation of Gellner's nationalist sentiment in global
      economy, and also the other way with global social respatialization
    - Nations as emotional conduits to rouse support for state governance
    - Most people do not move, and Facebook is a social bubble. Weak, but in
      need of a Gandhian figure.
    - What is key is control over devices of reproduction: schooling and mass
      communication. The government controls, but corporations...
    - Pobodnik mentions that capital has not managed to reacquire autonomy from
      political regulation, but especially with tech sector being new ground,
      lots of gaps showing up in the national framework (methodological
      territorialism from Scholte). The new East India Company.
    - Globalisation would require policy implementation, but those in charge of
      education either favour national interests (government) or neoliberal
      interests (corporations). No framework for reproduction.
    - Statelessness as an example, unable to continue without a framework of
      reproduction and trampled effectively by the advent of communication and
      fast, convenient travel.

## More pointers that don't fit in the other headings

- Use Gellner's theories on social reproduction.
- Use Scholte's book throughout for inspiration on what globalisation is, and
  how it would stack up in equivalent arguments on nationalism.
- Compare against the well known theorists. Hobsbawm's invented tradition.
  Anderson's imagined community. Gellner's political dissatisfaction.
- Use Anderson's Long-distance nationalism.
- Use control of the instruments of reproduction as an argument for other
  alternatives.

## Big picture

Will globalisation lead to the fading away of nationalism and nation-states?

- We will need to look at why nationalism and nations are so strong now
- We will need to look at other ideologies and "isms" that nationalism has
  triumphed over
- We will need to look at:
    - What globalisation really is
    - Will it also suffer the same deficiencies of the other "isms"

## Thinking of the argument

- No, it won't (triumph), because
- Global ideologies (Liberalism, Marxism) have not worked in the past due to:
    - Ideological rigidity, reducing reach
    - Though well defined, not filling the gaps of religion
    - Hypocrisy in implementation
- Globalisation has a lot to look for:
    - No invented tradition
    - No "other"
    - Need a Gandhi-like figure
    - Self-reproductive measure of society (education) is controlled by State
      (or private bodies -- more on those later)
    - A general lack of imagination
    - Gellner: homogenization *encourages* nations.
    - Ideology of the elites
    - It will be tamed by nationalism, OR
- A new challenger approaches!
    - Companies

## Random, general ~ideas~ to keep in mind

- Gellner's idea of a minimal self-reproducing unit is, in my opinion, the
  biggest factor that will come into play here. This is also how private
  companies are coming into the picture.
- Religion will play a part
- Specifically factor in how information-mediated impacts possible future.
- Include Statelessness from Intro to History somehow. About State-governance
  itself being a new feature, which could potentially be easily replaced by a
  new system.
- I've been thinking about neoliberal policy implementations of globalisation as
  the "new East India Company", allowing global enterprises operating in
  hitherto unknown scale to subvert the inherent limitations of territorial
  nationalism: a future ruled by corporations and not democratically
  elected governments.
    - Pobodnik's review of Bemyeh mentions that his discussions on the likely
      trajectory of global capitalism is "somewhat problematic" -- that capital
      has *not* managed to reacquire autonomy from political regulation, as
      evidenced by the events of 9/11.
      
      However, this was before the age of data, and of Big Tech as major
      contributors to social change and important political platforms. AWS
      us-east-1 going down meant washing machines stopped working, the general
      lack of ability to keep legislation up with technology.
    - From Scholte's book, *The State remains, but character shifts*. I think --
      trying to retain global companies, States are opening up, etc. Bending too
      far?

## Random, general points on the topic

I will sort them out later.

- The internet has strengthened nationalisms rather than weakening them, check
  Anderson's Long Distance Nationalism and Eriksen's Nationalism and the
  Internet.
- Nationalism as a way to consolidate power? This is what happened with Official
  Nationalism, and Communist States in power. Nationalism domesticated the other
  global policies.
- In order to replicate the idea of a global society: as it is located in Modern
  Society, the community can only establish itself through self-reproducing
  feature of an independent educational system, that is simultaneously approved
  by the State.
    - This might be possible with the new world order tm.
- There is no past for invented tradition to fall back on. Unless tradition is
  invoked on everyone in the world in the coup. What ritual can be called upon?
  Also, people will not like it because it interferes with existing national
  invented traditions, goes at odds with them, many of which have been
  constructed with "non-national" as the other to rally against.
  
  Social cohesion is not too strong either, there's no "other" unless it's
  constructed in some fashion.
- It's a weak drive, but you need a figure the stature of Gandhi to shift people
  to a competing ideology. (Gellner)
- ~~Just as universal education is homogenization of culture, a new economic
  system of monopolies and no privacy leads to a paradigm shift.~~
- Does this require the idea of Nations to die out entirely? This does not
  discount the existence of States, just Nations. Rather, the existence of
  globalisation alongside nations at the very least.
- Nations are largely imagined communities. Globalised society requires a
  similar imagination of community without the existence of the "other", maybe?
  
  Question: *Why. Are imagined communities that important?* You do need them to
  have a sense of "camaraderie" among nationals, which has as per Anderson given
  the push needed for the creation of nations. 
  
  Need proper imagination of the Nation. India, for instance, is sufficiently
  imagined due to the time taken by the nationalist movement to mature.
  Pakistan, for example, is not.
- Nationalisms created nations. 
- Nations allow for the existence of a "reason" to exist in the absence of
  religion
- Bringing in Gellner: nationalist sentiment is the anger aroused at the
  violation of the political principle of nationalism, which allows for
  nationalist movement. Successful globalisation would require a similar
  sentiment, of sorts, that could be aroused amongst people.
    - Gellner does talk of Industrial Society within the context of homogenized
      world conception, but does not look beyond its role in the emergence of
      nationalism. But this very point could be used?
- So globalisation is defined as "respatialization", so more transworld:
    - Social relations
    - Economics and Business
- How does Economic systems in globalised economy interact with the nation-state
  ideology?
- Mass of migration as a representation of global respatialization?
- Parallel to Gellner -- the "Literate High Culture" repeated; the upper classes
  can see the world as an global home: weekends in Paris, homes across
  countries, free travel. The middle classes only think of the world as vacation
  spots and a duty of returning to the nation, and most do not even get to see
  the world. Not literacy as a specialisation, but money.
    - Political ideology of the elites. Based on this conception, it's a policy
      implementation that restricts the reach and benefits of globalisation only
      to the top few. Consider the parallel in world football - giants like
      Real Madrid, PSG, Manchester City would all like to have a "Super" league
      where they compete with each other and take advantage of their global
      audiences, but this is opposed by the lower-rung teams in the national
      leagues due to the negative impact it will have on them, what with them
      lacking a major global following.
- Conversi keeps mentioning globalisation as all the first 4 definitions.

## Old Ideas

- What is globalisation?

  The Guardian: "what it meant most often was making it cheaper to trade across
  borders". State capitalism, Nations as economic entities in the free market.
  This, as per economists of late, has been failing.
  
  I think what we're looking for is the removal of nations altogether. I would
  argue that the idea of globalisation is inherently at odds with the idea of a
  nation, and having a nation alongside a global economic system means the
  nation will eventually triumph. So the question would then be, is there a
  possibility of a nation-less future? Rather than "can we have an economic
  system without boundaries while maintaining ~~state capitalism~~ blind
  adherence to the idea of a shared community bounded by nations?" Because to
  consider Gellner, economic-only globalisation while "nationalist" sentiments
  exist is a violation of the principle of political and national unit being
  congruent, hence Nationalist sentiment is arisen and made stronger.
  
  In a way economic globalisation is part of the larger view on globalisation, a
  major shift in how people think. It still needs State capitalism I think,
  because bodies of governance will want to maintain power. And maybe for that
  reason they'd *want* nationalist sentiments so people are incentivised to stay
  there? So maybe it won't work solely for such reasons?
  
- How is globalisation information-mediated? It seems more so that nationalist
  sentiment is on an uprise due to easy access to vast swathes of population,
  and its prevalence and viral nature. 

- Nationalism has survived more well thought out theories on the basis of
  replacing the spiritual, the irrational "why are we here" that a thought of
  scientific/semi-scientific method cannot answer.
  
  For globalisation to triumph, that's the role that needs to be filled. Which
  isn't easy. Nationalism piggybacks on divinity/imagery/an "other". Maybe
  religion didn't have an other as its final goal, but its existence would
  necessitate an other.
- Nationalism exists in an imagination of a shared time-space. Would
  globalisation as the new standard require a new such imagination of
  world-view? Maybe technology mediation means something? But like we saw
  earlier, currently technology is helping nationalism more than it is
  globalisation. But you also have the fact that Nationalism is a weak ideology
  (again, Gellner) so...
- Maybe globalisation will be promoted by this breakdown of the weakness?
  Realisation of potential nationalisms?
- Globalisation as an "ideology of elites". Nationalism bests it due to the
  numbers of the commons. Here we can possibly look at an analogue in Football:
  the biggest footballing clubs around the world want to band together to form a
  "Super league" for improved competition, viewership, and revenue. However,
  smaller ones do not want this - it will increase the disparity they already
  face as more people migrate away from them and the gap becomes astronomically
  harder to plug. Compare it, so, to "brain drain" - the "elite", capable of
  settling across the planet, prefer globalisation as a method to improve their
  personal standing, whereas the commons would rather they remain where they are
  and improve the situation of their peers.

[In reply to Saujas Vaduguru]
globalisation vs nationalisation, self-centric capitalism enabling globalisation
but class-specific

Zubair Abid, [23.10.20 18:12]
analogy to football super cup and the local leagues not liking that

Zubair Abid, [23.10.20 18:12]
brain drain as globalised but seen as brain drain by nationalists

Zubair Abid, [16.11.20 17:38]
so a Nation is weak due to the need for propagands and other potential nations
(gellner), but nationalism itself is strong because of how it fills the gap left 
in "explain what the purpose of life is" that something like logic cannot 
explain (anderson), right

Zubair Abid, [16.11.20 17:40]
because I get what Gellner is saying about inherent weakness but I can't think 
of an ideology that can replace it in modern thing
