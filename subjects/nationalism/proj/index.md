Write an essay to discuss either one of these two questions

1. Of the theories and definitions of Nation and Nationalism studied in this
   course, whose definition do you find best suited to understand nationalism in
   Indian today? Explain your answer by highlighting the insights you gained
   from this thinker, but also compared him to the others too, as well as take
   comparative examples from other countries' nationalisms too.
2. Will nationalism survive globalisation? Or will globalisation, in its current
   information technology mediated version, lead to the fading away of
   nationalism and nation-states?
