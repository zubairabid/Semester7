# Introduction

- There is an interesting dichotomy between the "globalisation is dead" messages
  and the "globalised society is the future" crowd. Which is the case?
- We are more specifically looking to see if and how it would impact the
  existence of Nationalism and the nation-state.
- For understanding Nationalism we rely heavily on @scholte_globalization_2005,  
  and we compare it against the various theories taught in class. Special
  emphasis will be given to the theory of the minimal self-reproducing unit
  required to sustain a community, introduced by @gellner_nations_1983
  [^gell_lab]

# Globalisation is not dead; What even is it?

- To make a case, we need to know what globalisation is in the first place.

## What globalisation is not

- Searching for Globalisation, we are met with a flood of articles announcing
  that it is dead -- most, from the financial fields. Hence you have
  @saval_globalisation_2017 writing on the "fall" of Globalisation due to (then)
  recently elected world-leaders opting for "nation first" approaches, or
  Michael O' Sullivan calling for a "new [multipolar] world order"
  [-@noauthor_globalisation_2019].
- These operate under an understanding of "globalisation" as a synonym for
  "internationalisation". Such a definition is not beneficial to begin with
  [^schol_prem] due to the redundancy. It also reduces globalisation to the
  limits of internationalisation, which by definition conceives the idea of
  nations as the primary political unit.
- Another common thread is to align it with liberalisation -- removing official
  border constraints on international trade and the like -- making globalisation
  about the spread of contemporary neoliberal macroeconomic policies
  [^schol_neolib]. The usual arguments about invalidity due to reduction apply,
  but this is important because as a policy implementation of
  'globalisation' for a majority of corporations and many countries, it is
  common to assume *neoliberalist globalisation* to be the only one available,
  and thus (the authors comment that) most opponents to
  to 'globalisation' are often just opposed to *neoliberalist globalisation*.
- Globalisation as Universalisation, and globalisation as Westernisation are the
  following two TODO write later

## Globalisation as a shift in social space

- For definition, we primarily use the proposal put forth by 
  @scholte_globalization_2005 - globalisation as a shift in the social space,
  expressed through the spread of transplanetary
  and supraterritorial connections between people. 
- Spatiality: operating now on Planet Earth, and not as a nation, or a village,
  or a community. This is a bold claim, and we're trying to justify why we claim
  that the social space has in fact shifted so much
- Transplanetary relations: by no means new, but definitely higher numbers due
  to cheap air travel. More social relations, more economics, more diseases,
  etc. Which is great, but it doesn't take us all the way there to a "shift" as
  described previously. Which is where supraterritoriality comes in.
- This is where communication comes in big: also the telephone, but especially
  the internet. Supraterritorial:
  
  > As the word suggests, ‘supraterritorial’ relations are social connections 
  > that substantially transcend territorial geography. They are relatively
  > delinked from territory, that is, spatial domains that are mapped on the 
  > land surface of the earth, plus any adjoining waters and air spheres. 
  
  Fast worldwide travel. Shared currencies, and exchange rates. Ecological
  changes affecting everyone. Global sports events. Events in Wuhan changing
  planetary history. Imagination of a common 'humanity' that gets emphasised
  whenever even private agencies like SpaceX send people to the ISS.
- Essentially: globalisation is a paradigm shift in many ways. Will it stand the
  test against nationalism?

// Ending lines: Globalisation makes sense, but how does it matter?

# Why do people herald the death of the nation-state?

# Outline

- Introduction
- Globalisation is not dead
    - Even though some economic arguments claim is
    - Define it, and give examples where you agree (5 definitions, cases against
      or for each in brief)
    - General agreement with the book, and mention how *this will all factor in*
    - Overall: summarise the book. 600 words.
- Why would people herald the death of the nation-state?
    - There's the whole globalisation OP not-fad respatialization thing. Global
      village, Economic liberation, yada yada.
    - Globalisation != Internationalisation, does not necessitate nations.
    - The internet eased communication in unreal, unexpected fashion. Two-way
      communication. State seemingly does not control this dimension. Most
      arguments were from earlier.
    - Gellner did say Nationalism was a weak force, a well tended garden
    - Scholte says the State remains, but its character shifts. Possible
      over-appeasement (but perhaps not to democratic globalisation)?
    - Bemyeh. Will get to responses to him later.
- Looking at history of nationalism, comparing against globalisation and
  viability:
    - Anderson's Imagined Community: No other
    - Kohn's Replacement for God: No cause
    - Gellner's Nationalism came first (so I don't forget: in Gellner's chicken
      and egg problem, the egg came first)
    - Hobsbawm's Invented Tradition: Maybe but how?
    - (Maybe) De-universalisation of literate high culture (in new shape)?
    - (Maybe) Alike to the "Colonial Indian Elite"? Football idea.
- How information-mediation may actually help nationalism:
    - Already exists a long-distance nationalism (Anderson)
    - Becomes worse with the internet (Eriksen, Conversi)
- Also other theories, that I cannot back as strongly, leaning towards...
    - Not viable due to violation of Gellner's nationalist sentiment in global
      economy, and also the other way with global social respatialization
    - Nations as emotional conduits to rouse support for state governance
    - Most people do not move, and Facebook is a social bubble. Weak, but in
      need of a Gandhian figure.
    - What is key is control over devices of reproduction: schooling and mass
      communication. The government controls, but corporations...
    - Pobodnik mentions that capital has not managed to reacquire autonomy from
      political regulation, but especially with tech sector being new ground,
      lots of gaps showing up in the national framework (methodological
      territorialism from Scholte). The new East India Company.
    - Globalisation would require policy implementation, but those in charge of
      education either favour national interests (government) or neoliberal
      interests (corporations). No framework for reproduction.
    - Statelessness as an example, unable to continue without a framework of
      reproduction and trampled effectively by the advent of communication and
      fast, convenient travel.

[^gell_lab]: More specifically, Gellner specified the need for a community to
sustain an independent educational system if it hoped to sustain itself in
modern society [see @gellner_nations_1983, pp. 32]. We will explore this later.

[^schol_prem]: See [@scholte_globalization_2005, pp. 52-54], on how
definitions should try to "advance knowledge", and why the new word should not 
be expressible as a synonym for another existing concept.

[^schol_neolib]: [@scholte_globalization_2005, pp. 56]. As the book says,
"large-scale globalization and widespread economic liberalization have
frequently transpired concurrently in the past quarter-century ...  it is quite  
something else to conflate the two concepts, so that globalization and 
liberalization become the same thing."
