# Introduction

- There is an interesting dichotomy between the "globalisation is dead" messages
  and the "globalised society is the future" crowd. Which is the case?
- We are more specifically looking to see if and how it would impact the
  existence of Nationalism and the nation-state.
- For understanding globalisation we rely heavily on 
  @scholte_globalization_2005,
  and we compare it against the various theories taught in class. Special
  emphasis will be given to the theory of the minimal self-reproducing unit
  required to sustain a community, introduced by @gellner_nations_1983
  [^gell_lab]

# Globalisation is not dead; What even is it?

- To make a case, we need to know what globalisation is in the first place.

## What globalisation is not

- Searching for Globalisation, we are met with a flood of articles announcing
  that it is dead -- most, from the financial fields. Hence you have
  @saval_globalisation_2017 writing on the "fall" of Globalisation due to (then)
  recently elected world-leaders opting for "nation first" approaches, or
  Michael O' Sullivan calling for a "new [multipolar] world order"
  [-@noauthor_globalisation_2019].
- These operate under an understanding of "globalisation" as a synonym for
  "internationalisation". Such a definition is not beneficial to begin with
  [^schol_prem] due to the redundancy. It also reduces globalisation to the
  limits of internationalisation, which by definition conceives the idea of
  nations as the primary political unit.
- Another common thread is to align it with liberalisation -- removing official
  border constraints on international trade and the like -- making globalisation
  about the spread of contemporary neoliberal macroeconomic policies
  [^schol_neolib]. The usual arguments about invalidity due to reduction apply,
  but this is important because as a policy implementation of
  'globalisation' for a majority of corporations and many countries, it is
  common to assume *neoliberalist globalisation* to be the only one available,
  and thus (the authors comment that) most opponents to
  to 'globalisation' are often just opposed to *neoliberalist globalisation*.
- Globalisation as Universalisation, and globalisation as Westernisation are the
  following two TODO write later

## Globalisation as a shift in social space

- For definition, we primarily use the proposal put forth by 
  @scholte_globalization_2005 - globalisation as a shift in the social space,
  expressed through the spread of transplanetary
  and supraterritorial connections between people. 
- Spatiality: operating now on Planet Earth, and not as a nation, or a village,
  or a community. This is a bold claim, and we're trying to justify why we claim
  that the social space has in fact shifted so much
- Transplanetary relations: by no means new, but definitely higher numbers due
  to cheap air travel. More social relations, more economics, more diseases,
  etc. Which is great, but it doesn't take us all the way there to a "shift" as
  described previously. Which is where supraterritoriality comes in.
- This is where communication comes in big: also the telephone, but especially
  the internet. Supraterritorial:
  
  > As the word suggests, ‘supraterritorial’ relations are social connections 
  > that substantially transcend territorial geography. They are relatively
  > delinked from territory, that is, spatial domains that are mapped on the 
  > land surface of the earth, plus any adjoining waters and air spheres.
  > [^scholte_supra]
  
  Fast worldwide travel. Shared currencies, and exchange rates. Ecological
  changes affecting everyone. Global sports events. Events in Wuhan changing
  planetary history. Imagination of a common 'humanity' that gets emphasised
  whenever even private agencies like SpaceX send people to the ISS.
- Essentially: globalisation is a paradigm shift in many ways. Will it stand the
  test against nationalism?

# Why do people herald the death of the nation-state?

- Given this rudimentary understanding of globalisation, we are yet to examine
  exactly why it has been heralded as the successor to the ideology of
  nationalism. We look at that now.
- For some context, we should be aware that the bulk of the work surveyed was in
  the 90s/early 2000s, in the heyday of global optimism.

## A Paradigm Shift

- The conditions that allowed globalisation as a viable ideology -- better
  communication and transport across vast distances -- was a paradigm shift in
  how people perceived the world. One might imagine instantaneous communication
  akin to the printing press [^press_comm], a revolution in communication -- the
  way the latter was the herald of print capitalism. And not just telephonic or
  internet network-based communications: broadcast radio and television, global
  brands in peoples' day-to-day lives, and the
  ability to travel the world in under a day all brought about an awareness of
  'global consciousness' to the masses, something that was a hundred years ago 
  "generally limited to fleeting perceptions in limited élite circles"
  [^schol_globcons]. Globalisation -- when not perceived as Internationalisation
  -- allowed people to imagine themselves as global citizens in a discourse
  dominated by nation, be a "man without his shadow" sans the ostracization
  [^gell_shadow].

## Democratization of the Internet, if only for a brief moment

- A key factor played by the internet here is in its access to a bilateral
  information flow -- and in earlier days, the general democratic nature
  [^intanarch] of it.
- Previously with radio and television, information flow was centralised. Sure,
  people could talk to each other on the phone in a rudimentary peer-to-peer
  "network", but it did not match the scale the government, or ad company, or
  media group had. This is something we consider central to Gellner's theory of
  community self-reproduction: when the nation controls the information, even
  with democratic checks and balances the propaganda required to sustain the
  state can come through unfettered and unchallenged. With the internet as an
  open-to-all forum, the means of publishing was decentralised (if only for a
  short while) [^intreach].
- Chat rooms and USENETs/Forums gave people the ability to talk to a lot of
  people they did not know, unlike with telephones where at least some
  knowledge of the other person was a prerequisite. Access to a global state of
  sorts, in line with the respatialization mentioned earlier.
- This is not entirely the case now. Private corporations based in the United
  States provide much of the services we use on the internet today, and users
  are bound to adhere to the rules set in place by them -- sometimes in good
  faith, sometimes not. China monitors their entire population of a billion and
  some more.
- Even under corporate control, there is still dissemination of information from
  more than just one side. It is only under censorship -- which does happen --
  that groups are unable to share their opinions, and so far these are mostly
  bypassable censors by individual companies. As for States trying to control
  the content on the internet, well, as [@conversi_irresponsible_2012, pp. 13]
  puts it:
  
  > Attempts to control the web over ideological content and ethnic dissent can 
  > occur only at the price of curtailing fundamental human rights.
- Gellner called nationalism "inherently weak", requiring constant propaganda to
  keep up the nationalist sentiment. A democratic mass communication system seems 
  to be, at first glance, at odds with that. But Gellner's statement was on the
  influence of a particular nation, and not nationalism the concept as a whole.
  The democratization of the internet did change *some things* with regards to
  nations, but it was never realistically competing against the ideology as a
  whole.

## Misc.

- Scholte said that State remains, character shifts. Sometimes it isn't the only
  mode of governance any more, some times not even the principal one. Continuity
  theorists claim otherwise. Theoretically, a global company by its refusal to
  engage in business in a country, can influence to an extent the laws and
  regulations of the business. However as China showed, this may not be true
  with Chinese divisions of major global companies with different rulebooks
  popping up due to internal competition. However however, it *is* China so
  universal applicability may vary.
- @bamyeh_ends_2000 makes some bold claims in his book, "The Ends of
  Globalisation", speaking of the inherent totalitarianism of nations
  [^bamyeh_total] and the inevitability of globalisation. His analysis is
  pre-9/11 and slightly dated for the reason -- not anticipating the infusion of
  purpose the attacks would give the American people a year later, he claims the
  nation is "purposeless", assigning vague enmity to sporadic terrorist groups
  in a drought of rivals in the post-Cold War period. In a review of his work
  @podobnik_review_2006 mentins that his discussion on the likely trajectory of
  global capitalism is "somewhat problematic" -- that capital had not in fact,
  contrary to claims, managed to reacquire autonomy from political regulation,
  as evidenced by post 9/11.

# Comparing against Nationalism

- Over class, we have discussed many ways to analyse why Nationalism is as
  strong as it is. So now, we will apply the same lenses of analysis to
  Globalisation as well. TODO write more

## Anderson's Imagined Community

## Kohn's Replacement for Religion

## Gellner's Nationalism precedes Nations

## Hobsbawm's Invented Tradition

## Gellner's Literate High Culture

## Likening to the "Colonial Indian Elite"

# Information-mediated Nationalism

# Outline

- Introduction
- Globalisation is not dead
    - Even though some economic arguments claim is
    - Define it, and give examples where you agree (5 definitions, cases against
      or for each in brief)
    - General agreement with the book, and mention how *this will all factor in*
    - Overall: summarise the book. 600 words.
- Why would people herald the death of the nation-state?
    - There's the whole globalisation OP not-fad respatialization thing. Global
      village, Economic liberation, yada yada.
    - Globalisation != Internationalisation, does not necessitate nations.
    - The internet eased communication in unreal, unexpected fashion. Two-way
      communication. State seemingly does not control this dimension. Most
      arguments were from earlier.
    - Gellner did say Nationalism was a weak force, a well tended garden
    - Scholte says the State remains, but its character shifts. Possible
      over-appeasement (but perhaps not to democratic globalisation)?
    - Bemyeh. Will get to responses to him later.
- Looking at history of nationalism, comparing against globalisation and
  viability:
    - Anderson's Imagined Community: No other
    - Kohn's Replacement for God: No cause
    - Gellner's Nationalism came first (so I don't forget: in Gellner's chicken
      and egg problem, the egg came first)
    - Hobsbawm's Invented Tradition: Maybe but how?
    - (Maybe) De-universalisation of literate high culture (in new shape)?
    - (Maybe) Alike to the "Colonial Indian Elite"? Football idea.
- How information-mediation may actually help nationalism:
    - Already exists a long-distance nationalism (Anderson)
    - Becomes worse with the internet (Eriksen, Conversi)
- Also other theories, that I cannot back as strongly, leaning towards...
    - Not viable due to violation of Gellner's nationalist sentiment in global
      economy, and also the other way with global social respatialization
    - Nations as emotional conduits to rouse support for state governance
    - Most people do not move, and Facebook is a social bubble. Weak, but in
      need of a Gandhian figure.
    - What is key is control over devices of reproduction: schooling and mass
      communication. The government controls, but corporations...
    - Pobodnik mentions that capital has not managed to reacquire autonomy from
      political regulation, but especially with tech sector being new ground,
      lots of gaps showing up in the national framework (methodological
      territorialism from Scholte). The new East India Company.
    - Globalisation would require policy implementation, but those in charge of
      education either favour national interests (government) or neoliberal
      interests (corporations). No framework for reproduction.
    - Statelessness as an example, unable to continue without a framework of
      reproduction and trampled effectively by the advent of communication and
      fast, convenient travel.

[^gell_lab]: More specifically, Gellner specified the need for a community to
sustain an independent educational system if it hoped to sustain itself in
modern society [see @gellner_nations_1983, pp. 32]. We will explore this later.

[^schol_prem]: See [@scholte_globalization_2005, pp. 52-54], on how
definitions should try to "advance knowledge", and why the new word should not 
be expressible as a synonym for another existing concept.

[^schol_neolib]: [@scholte_globalization_2005, pp. 56]. As the book says,
"large-scale globalization and widespread economic liberalization have
frequently transpired concurrently in the past quarter-century ...  it is quite  
something else to conflate the two concepts, so that globalization and 
liberalization become the same thing."

[^press_comm]: It is true that telephonic conversation was a thing since the
late nineteenth century, but as Scholte noted in his chapter "Globalization in
History", early phone and telegraph systems were slow, unreliable, and very
expensive -- as such, unavailable to a vast majority of even the 'civilised'
world.

[^schol_globcons]: [see @scholte_globalization_2005, pp. 116]

[^gell_shadow]: [@gellner_nations_1983, pp. 6] spoke of how it is
near-impossible for someone to imagine themselves nation-less: statelessness is
still imaginable, if not viable, but to be without a nation would be like a man
without a shadow (his interpretation of a book by Chamisso, a French immigrant
in Germany).

[^intanarch]: Now, a case can be made to claim that the early internet was
*anarchist*, not democratic. The point here is that it was not controlled by
centralised State governments, or private firms.

[^intreach]: It is worth clarifying that "mass communication" was limited to
people capable of getting on the internet in some capacity, which -- without the
ample support of governments and corporations, is a rather small number limited
primarily to enthusiasts and academics. So while it is one thing to wax and wane
about the "death of the free and democratic internet", it was never a democratic
system in the first place if only a small "elite" could access it -- and the
unfettered universal reach of the netizen-journalist was limited to this group.

[^bamyeh_total]: @bamyeh_ends_2000 says,
"In an age of nation-states, everyone wanted to hear the good news that 
nationalism and totalitarianism could be disentangled from each other. Only a 
few had the bad manners to try to spoil the feast by pointing out the obvious, 
namely, that the preconditions of totalitarianism ... for example, 
singled out—the transformation of classes into masses, the elimination of all 
group solidarity, a pervasive sense of individual loneliness—are conducive just 
as well to national mobilization."
