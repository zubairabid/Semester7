Agenda: Syntax (Co‑inductive Terms)
• Last time, we had terms, defined in terms of induction and expression:

Defining a base case for an expression
Inductively, defining the set of all expressions
This was done for an operation

• This time, we will focus on Structural Induction: on trees, instead of 𝑛

Generalising induction
• We want to define terms inductively. Inductive terms
• We assume an alphabet Σ of constructor symbols
– What are constructor symbols? Kind of like functions that operate on some terms (arity, as
we shall find out) and return terms as results. Think of the ‘+’ operator.
– Eg: Σ = {𝑓, 𝑔, 𝑎, 𝑏}
• We define an “arity” function that operates on 𝛼 ∶ Σ → 𝑁 (Natural numbers)
– Arity defines how many parameters the operator can take.
– Eg: 𝛼(𝑓) = 2, 𝛼(𝑔) = 1, 𝛼(𝑎) = 𝛼(𝑏) = 0
• So, terms can be built like:
1 f(a(), b()) \_ inductively building terms
2 f(g(a), b) /

• So, to define inductive terms: Given a constructor symbol f with arity ɑ(f) = n and n terms, f(the
n terms) = a new term
1 ₁
2 t ... n terms and α(f) = n
3 ---------------------------4
f(₁t ... n terms) is a term

• Can be used to make judgements on terms (slide below)

Figure 1: What is an inductive proof
• wordy definition of this:
– if 𝑡1 ...𝑡𝑛 Terms
– and 𝑓 ∈ Σ s.t. 𝛼(𝑓) = 𝑛
– then 𝑓(𝑡1 ...𝑡𝑛 ) is a term
• The set of all Inductive terms over Σ ⟹ 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑑 (Σ) is the smallest set satisfying the above proper‑
ties:
1 So
∑T would have:
2
a, b, f a b, g a, g b, f g a b, f a g b,
3
g f a b, f g f a b a, etc

• Why bother with a boring induction based proof? We will move on to eventually define eval‑
uation itself as an induction system, not just terms.

Figure 2: Example of an inductive proof
• What is a set 𝑋 = Σ(𝑋). We need the least solution, as there are many.
𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑑 is the least solution.
Saying that this is the least solution and giving the definition of it is identical. ‑ Is it possible to have
‘infinite’ terms?

Any proof is a finite structure
The set itself is infinite
But every element in the set if finitely constructed
𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑑 = Σ(𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑑 ) ⊂ 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑑
