- paths == position
- pos(t1): all paths to all accessible vs.
- Term can be reconstructed from pos v and → ∑
- Position space: set of positions p, prefix closed: for all terms of the set, 
  each prefix is also a term in the set. *Motivation*: Eliminating v 
  
  Basically defines term v, without the v. 1 Position space defines a term 
  graph's subtree.
- Behaviour: mapping from terms to ∑, but upwards complete. Interaction.
