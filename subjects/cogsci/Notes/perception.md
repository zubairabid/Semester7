- Perception's nature:
    - rapid, effortless
    - adaptive
    - selective
    - based on patterns
    - dynamic
    - involves reasoning
- There is:
    - bottom-up: starting from stimulus, assembling sensory information. Data
      driven
    - top-down: perception from prior knowledge, using models. Theory driven
- Bottom up:
    - Feature detectors first step
    - Recognition By Components theory
    - *geons*: perceptual building blocks
- Top-down:
    - Where's Waldo
    - Higher-level brain primes lower level for patterns
- Perceptual constancy: size and shape:
    - Small person is person far away
    - door is door in any position
    - teacup oval at angle is actually circle
- Timbre constancy
- Psychophysics:
    - Psychometric function: formula relating subjective experience to prop of
      physical stimulus.
    - Laws basics: amount of stimulus needed to notice a change depends on what
      you already have
    - Just Noticeable Difference: Weber's Law. $$\frac{\Delta I}{I} = k$$
    - Helmholtz's theory of unconscious inference
- Gestalt theory: whole is something else than the sum of its parts:
    - *pragnanz*: perceive and interpret ambiguous/complex in simplest form
    - Filling in the gaps
    - Figure-ground: what we see as figure (obj), and what we perceive as ground
      (context)
    - These are *heuristics*
- Experience-Dependent Plasticity
- Mirror neurons
- Musicians vs non-musicians listening to music
