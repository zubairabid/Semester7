**Objective**: Describing general structure of Cerebrum and Cerebral Cortex.

- Gyri: ridge
- Sulci: groove
- Fissure: deep groove
- Sensation (Raw Data) vs Perception (interpretation)
- CNS (Brain, Spinal Cord) vs PNS (Branch off from CNS)
- Parasympathetic (Rest/Digest) vs Sympathetic (Fight/Flight) Nervous system
- Nervous system structure:
    - Dendrite
    - Cell body (soma)
    - Axon (nerve fiber)
    - Nodes of Ranvier
    - Synapses (one axon to another neuron's dendrite gap)
    - Touch receptor 
- Electrical vs Chemical synapses:
    - Directly connected vs gap
    - Faster no gain vs slower with gain
    - typically bidirectional vs usually unidirectional
- Glial Cells:
    - non neuronal, form myelin, maintain homeostasis
- Types of Neurons:
    - Unipolar (insects)
    - Bipolar (rare, like retina)
    - Pseudo-unipolar
    - Multi-polar (most common)
- Sensort neurons:
    - thermoreceptors
    - photoreceptors
    - chemoreceptors
    - mechanoreceptors
- Action Potentials:
    - temporary shift from negative to positive membrane potential
- Localisation vs distributed processing
- Feature detectors:
    - certain neuron populations respond to specific types of stimuli/features
- Neural code: specificity and distributed coding
- Thalamus: Control and relay center for sensory info
- Hypothalamus:
    - Intermediary: nervous, endocrine systems
    - Control system of ANS
    - Regulates basics survival mechanisms
