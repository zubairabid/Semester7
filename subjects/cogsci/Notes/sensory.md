# Tactile

- Pain, temperature, pressure, pleasure
- Somatosensory cortex:
    - Sensations are perceived here
    - *homunculus*: topological map of the surface of body, some more focus
      (like lips, hand, etc)
    - Violin players have larger representation areas in left hand fingers
- Two point discrimination:
    - Based on receptive field of sensory neurons at a point
    - Is indicative of Tactile Acuity

# Pain

- Gate control theory:
    - non-painful input closes gates, so just massaging painful area isn't
      painful.
    - Small nerve fibers open the gate, large close it
- Phantom limb: reorganisation of neural connections - neural plasticity
- remapping hypothesis, sensations felt in both face and phantom limb. Maybe
  sensory homunculus is adjacent
- Mirror therapy, VR treatment for phantom limb
- Somatosensory illusions

# Hearing

- Outer ear catch, middle ear amplify, inner ear send messages
- Middle ear has *Malleus, Incus, Stapes*
- Inner ear has Vestibular system (balance) and Cochlea (hearing)
- Cochlea has tonotopic map. Frequency coding.
- Auditory cortex and dual pathways
- Broca's area: speech production
- Wernicke's area: speech comprehension
- | Sensation | Perception |
  |-----------|------------|
  | Amplitude | Loudness   |
  | Frequency | Pitch      |
  | ?         | Timbre     |
- Auditory hallucinations related to Broca's area: more about speech synthesis
  in brain than comprehension
- Tinnitus: damage from acoustical trauma, infections, age, etc

# Olfaction

- Chemoreceptors
- Olfactory bulb directly in forebrain
- Animals superior to humans

# Gustation

- gustatory cortex not same as tongue area of somatosensory cortex but close
- Taste: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami
- Papillae: circumvallate, foilate, fungiform
- Supertasters: larger number of tightly arranged papillae. More sensitive to
  bitter.
- CD36 --> fat: sixth taste compound?
- 80% of taste is aroma through orthonasal (nose) and retronasal (mouth)
- Computational Gastronomy
- Gastrophysics
- White mug preferred for dark coffee
- Stronger preferred by brighter bg light

# Multisensory integration

- Superior Colliculus is an Integration center
- Olfactory tubercule: auditory + olfactory
- Examples of crossmodal:
    - Sonic chip
    - digital seasoning
    - plate shape/colour affecting taste and quality judgements
- Orbitofrontal cortex: inputs from primary olfactory, gustatory, secondary
  somatosensory, superior (auditory) and inferior (visual) temporal gyrus, and
  emotion centers (amygdala)
- Synesthesia:
    - grapheme-colour
    - chromosthesia
    - number-form
    - personification
    - lexical-gustatory
- Learned associations:
    - cinnamon as sweet vs spicy
    - Masculine perfume as manager
    - lower pitch as a leader
