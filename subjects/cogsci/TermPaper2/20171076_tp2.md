  Examining evidence against the Action vs Perception Hypothesis proposed by
  @goodale_separate_1992, with experiments on visual illusions
abstract: |
  @ungerleide_two_1982 proposed based on lesion studies on monkeys that in
  primate brains, visual information was processed in two streams -- dorsal and
  ventral. @goodale_separate_1992 reinterpreted this theory, making a species
  jump to humans and suggesting that the dorsal stream had the purpose of
  guiding the manipulation of objects (action) and the ventral stream did the
  computations necessary for object recognition (perception). I have picked two
  papers that disagree with this, one via experimentation
  [@franz_grasping_2000], and the other by an analysis of existing work at the
  time [@franz_action_2001]. In this term paper, I will be explaining the
  phenomenon being considered in the first place, the cognitive processes
  involved, a quick summary of the experiments and arguments, noted gaps in the
  treatment, potential extensions to the study, and my own suggestions on future
  experimentation.
