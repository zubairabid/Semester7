  Examining evidence against the Action vs Perception Hypothesis proposed by
  @goodale_separate_1992, with experiments on visual illusions
abstract: |
  @ungerleide_two_1982 proposed based on lesion studies on monkeys that in
  primate brains, visual information was processed in two streams -- dorsal and
  ventral. @goodale_separate_1992 reinterpreted this theory, making a species
  jump to humans and suggesting that the dorsal stream had the purpose of
  guiding the manipulation of objects (action) and the ventral stream did the
  computations necessary for object recognition (perception). I have picked two
  papers that disagree with this, one via experimentation
  [@franz_grasping_2000], and the other by an analysis of existing work at the
  time [@franz_action_2001]. In this term paper, I will be explaining the
  phenomenon being considered in the first place, the cognitive processes
  involved, a quick summary of the experiments and arguments, noted gaps in the
  treatment, potential extensions to the study, and my own suggestions on future
  experimentation.

# What are we looking at?

- Studies with visual illusions have been used to propose evidence for the
  separate visual processing pathways theory. We're looking at
  counter-arguments: studies that look at the same illusions with different
  experimental setups and justify why the original proposal is not so.

## The original hypothesis, and responses 

- In brief: the theory is that primate visual system is organised into two
  parallel pathways. @goodale_separate_1992 suggested extending it to humans
  too, using an experimental setup around the Ebbinghaus illusion. Hereon this
  will be referred to as 'the hypothesis'
- Initially received positively, more critical pieces tackling gaps and flaws in
  the original experiments came up. I'm looking at one such response 
  [@franz_grasping_2000] that sets up an experiment contradicting Goodale's 
  [-@goodale_separate_1992] results, and also adds a few more to refute 
  assumptions taken to be true in earlier work. I will also be looking at
  @franz_action_2001, that looks at publications on the topic at the time and
  highlights methodological concerns with all the work agreeing with Goodale's
  [-@goodale_separate_1992] original work.

## The Cognitive Processes involved

- Vision:
    - Perception
    - The hypothesis suggests that this is a complex task involving
      computations for object recognition and conscious perception, taking up
      the ventral stream of processing.
- Motor:
    - Estimation
    - The hypothesis suggests that this is taken care of by the dorsal stream,
      where the focus is on quick computation and short-term memory that can
      locate objects (that might be moving) and start acting towards performing
      operations on them.

# What has been shown: The Experiments and Arguments

- Background: all the experiments generally look for perception vs action, and
  all of them use the Ebbinghaus illusion.
- Perception is represented most often by trying to adjust an external circle to
  the size of the internal one, or if both are given simultaneously the task 
  sometimes is to adjust both so they end up the same size (if they aren't
  physical circles).
- For action, the common task is to ask the subject to grasp the central circle
  (which is a physical object), with various adjustments against possible biases
  (such as only showing the circle for a second or so before asking the subject
  to grasp it). External tracking systems are used to achieve this.
- The most prominent results -- @aglioti_size-contrast_1995 -- 
  found that there was less effect of the illusion on grasping versus
  perception.

## @franz_grasping_2000

- Observations on prior experiments:
    - it is setup such that both are shown side by side. They hypothesise that
      this increases the time taken for visual distinction, whereas with
      grasping the subject is only looking and acting on a single stimulus.
    - More specifically, the problem is the assumption that "the perceptual 
      effects of the two Ebbinghaus figures simply add up to yield the effect 
      obtained by the direct comparison".
- Experimental setup 1:
    - They setup experiment 1 with an alternate experiment construction, where
      only one of the stimuli is available to the subject at a time. So instead
      of seeing both side by side, the subject was shown only one at a time, and
      had to make adjustments accordingly.
    - More details
    - What they saw: similar effect of both visual and action tasks.
- Experimental setups 2 and 3:
    - These experiments are setup to verify that the "additive effect" that 
      earlier studies assumed would hold, does not hold for the case of
      Ebbinghaus figures -- essentially, that the direct comparison led to a
      larger perceptual effect than when one took the sum of the effects in
      separate comparisons.
    - For experiment 2, the perceptual setup was repeated, only this time with
      three variations: first with the experimental setup used in Experiment 1,
      then with the setup by @aglioti_size-contrast_1995, and then with a third
      setup they had proposed to simulate the grasping task of the original
      studies.
    - As expected, results demonstrated exactly the goal of the experiment --
      that the perceptual effect of direct comparison was more than the sum of
      the effects taken individually, and so the assumption of the additive 
      effect was a failure of the original study.
    - Experiment 3 was setup to counter a possible argument: that the original
      setup had subjects compare the two disks immediately before grasping. This
      setup was replicated by requiring participants to first compare the
      central circles directly before the comparison to an isolated circle. In
      theory, this simulates the original experiment, so if additivity is a
      property of such then it should be demonstrated here too. Results, again,
      indicated otherwise -- direct comparison was greater than the sum of
      separate comparisons.

## @franz_action_2001

- Most shit agrees with @franz_grasping_2000
- Everything that doesn't can fall in the "non-standard" measures
- Here's why nonstandard doesn't work

# Gaps and Future work

## Major Gaps

- In the grasping tasks, the object is 3D and the screen image is 2D. This
  reduces the perceptual effect. They try to counter it, but it is acknowedged
  as a concern, maybe an all-physical setup would be better. 
- Experiment 3 is handwavy - claims that this is a reasonable explanation, but
  does not elaborate on why
- @carey_action_2001 suggested that the results meant that motor system only
  takes into account a close area around the target, and perceptual system has
  to attend to the whole thing.

## How to extend the studies

- Use an all-physical setup.
- To "match the task demands" they could try something TODO
