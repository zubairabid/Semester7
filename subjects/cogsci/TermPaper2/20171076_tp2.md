  Examining evidence against the Action vs Perception Hypothesis proposed by
  @goodale_separate_1992, with experiments on visual illusions
abstract: |
  @ungerleide_two_1982 proposed based on lesion studies on monkeys that in
  primate brains, visual information was processed in two streams -- dorsal and
  ventral. @goodale_separate_1992 reinterpreted this theory, making a species
  jump to humans and suggesting that the dorsal stream had the purpose of
  guiding the manipulation of objects (action) and the ventral stream did the
  computations necessary for object recognition (perception). I have picked two
  papers that disagree with this, one via experimentation
  [@franz_grasping_2000], and the other by an analysis of existing work at the
  time [@franz_action_2001]. In this term paper, I will be explaining the
  phenomenon being considered in the first place, the cognitive processes
  involved, a quick summary of the experiments and arguments, noted gaps in the
  treatment, potential extensions to the study, and my own suggestions on future
  experimentation.

# What are we looking at?

- Studies with visual illusions have been used to propose evidence for the
  separate visual processing pathways theory. We're looking at
  counter-arguments: studies that look at the same illusions with different
  experimental setups and justify why the original proposal is not so.

## The original hypothesis, and responses 

- In brief: the theory is that primate visual system is organised into two
  parallel pathways. @goodale_separate_1992 suggested extending it to humans
  too, using an experimental setup around the Ebbinghaus illusion. Hereon this
  will be referred to as 'the hypothesis'
- Initially received positively, more critical pieces tackling gaps and flaws in
  the original experiments came up. I'm looking at one such response 
  [@franz_grasping_2000] that sets up an experiment contradicting Goodale's 
  [-@goodale_separate_1992] results, and also adds a few more to refute 
  assumptions taken to be true in earlier work. I will also be looking at
  @franz_action_2001, that looks at publications on the topic at the time and
  highlights methodological concerns with all the work agreeing with Goodale's
  [-@goodale_separate_1992] original work.

## The Cognitive Processes involved

- Vision:
    - Perception
    - The hypothesis suggests that this is a complex task involving
      computations for object recognition and conscious perception, taking up
      the ventral stream of processing.
- Motor:
    - Estimation
    - The hypothesis suggests that this is taken care of by the dorsal stream,
      where the focus is on quick computation and short-term memory that can
      locate objects (that might be moving) and start acting towards performing
      operations on them.
