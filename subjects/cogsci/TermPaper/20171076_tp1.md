1. **When asked to name the object seen in the image (below), the answers range 
   from bird, boat, just irregular shapes, to hanuman. But if someone sees 
   'snow-covered farm buildings', then it is perception. Now understand a) what
   can be the possible explanation for someone to 'see' snow-covered farm 
   building? and b) given most Indians have not seen such a scene how will they
   form it given the clue?**

   - Top-down perception. Gestalt principles. [@todorovic_gestalt_2008]
   - Experience of having seen snow covered farm buildings, so recognises the
     pattern. Experience-dependent plasticity. [@blakemore_development_1970]
   - A situation would be whiteout, white everywhere except for walls because
     snow is not sticking on vertical surfaces.
   - Indians:
       - Not matching it instantly, so trying to process bottom-up. Does not fit
         any mental model.
       - Everyone was ignoring the whitespace
       - Lots of answers were dinosaur - maybe inspired by the chrome game? It
         also has blocky dinosaur, made entirely from simple dark shapes.
         Whitespace does not play a part in that.
       - Some fun answers:
           - view of distant mountain + sailboat from a jetty (white space
             considered)
           - Broken sphinx
           - Anime Hair
           - Mountain and valley with river (again, completely ignoring
             whitespace)
           - 2004 graphics superman
           - When I mentioned "wouldn't see this in most of India" - Robot Dog
       - The person who lives in Boston for 3 years instantly got it.
       - Only one person got it without a "climate" hint
   - How it's being formed: bottom up. Trying to identify the big triangle as a
     wing and that below as a tail (dragon). Or making the upwards-triangles
     mountains and the other black section river. RBC.
     [@biederman_recognition-by-components_1987]
   - Even after getting it one person kept seeing the roof in the front as a
     garbage dump - like in Tom and Jerry, or the Maguire Spider-man movies - as
     that was the experience and not a farmhouse.

2. **“Mirror Neuron Theory is a myth.” Explain the mirror neuron theory based on 
   Giacomo Rizzolatti’s work. What are the criticisms against it and what is 
   your opinion on this debate?**
   
   - Explanation
   - Criticisms
