1. **When asked to name the object seen in the image (below), the answers range 
   from bird, boat, just irregular shapes, to hanuman. But if someone sees 
   'snow-covered farm buildings', then it is perception. Now understand a) what
   can be the possible explanation for someone to 'see' snow-covered farm 
   building? and b) given most Indians have not seen such a scene how will they
   form it given the clue?**
   
   ![Perception experiment](./tdbu.png)
   
   - When trying to perceive an object, there are two general approaches: a
     top-down approach and a bottom-up approach. Each is triggered differently
     based on experience [@blakemore_development_1970] - if the object we see
     matches our visual experience, then we identify it as such without trying
     to identify individual components - think of how we see a car rather than a
     door, a hood, etc. If it does not, we try to identify the object by
     identifying individual components and trying to make sense of it together,
     or Recognition by Components, introduced by
     @biederman_recognition-by-components_1987.
   - Especially with limited silhouetted images like this one, identification is
     done by heuristics. Gestalt principles (introduced by 
     [@ogpaperishouldveadded], and claimed by @todorovic_gestalt_2008] as still
     applicable to modern perception theory.
   - Experience of having seen snow covered farm buildings, so recognises the
     pattern. Experience-dependent plasticity. [@blakemore_development_1970]
   - A situation would be whiteout, white everywhere except for walls because
     snow is not sticking on vertical surfaces.
   - Indians:
       - Not matching it instantly, so trying to process bottom-up. Does not fit
         any mental model.
       - Everyone was ignoring the whitespace
       - Lots of answers were dinosaur - maybe inspired by the chrome game? It
         also has blocky dinosaur, made entirely from simple dark shapes.
         Whitespace does not play a part in that.
       - Some fun answers:
           - view of distant mountain + sailboat from a jetty (white space
             considered)
           - Broken sphinx
           - Anime Hair
           - Mountain and valley with river (again, completely ignoring
             whitespace)
           - 2004 graphics superman
           - When I mentioned "wouldn't see this in most of India" - Robot Dog
       - The person who lives in Boston for 3 years instantly got it.
       - Only one person got it without a "climate" hint
   - How it's being formed: bottom up. Trying to identify the big triangle as a
     wing and that below as a tail (dragon). Or making the upwards-triangles
     mountains and the other black section river. RBC.
     [@biederman_recognition-by-components_1987]
   - Even after getting it one person kept seeing the roof in the front as a
     garbage dump - like in Tom and Jerry, or the Maguire Spider-man movies - as
     that was the experience and not a farmhouse.

2. **“Mirror Neuron Theory is a myth.” Explain the mirror neuron theory based on 
   Giacomo Rizzolatti’s work. What are the criticisms against it and what is 
   your opinion on this debate?**
   
   - Explanation:
       - Broadly, the mirror neuron theory posits that "motor representation is
         at the basis of the understanding of motor events"
         [@pascolo_mirror-neuron_2009]. The same neurons react not only to doing
         an action, but also watching it.
       - [@pascolo_mirror-neuron_2009]'s work noted that mirror neurons
         exist in the frontal F5 area of the Macaque monkey, and these respond
         *both* when monkeys make active movements, and when they observe
         someone make meaningful movements. They also suggested that data of how
         observation of motor actions activated the posterior part of the 
         inferior frontal gyrus in humans implied the existence of mirror
         neurons in humans too, which could be affecting verbal development in
         humans due to the homology of F5 with Broca's area.
