1. **When asked to name the object seen in the image (below), the answers range 
   from bird, boat, just irregular shapes, to hanuman. But if someone sees 
   'snow-covered farm buildings', then it is perception. Now understand a) what
   can be the possible explanation for someone to 'see' snow-covered farm 
   building? and b) given most Indians have not seen such a scene how will they
   form it given the clue?**
   
   ![Perception experiment](./tdbu.png)
   
   When trying to perceive an object, there are two general approaches: a
   top-down approach and a bottom-up approach. Each is triggered differently
   based on experience [@blakemore_development_1970] - if the object we see
   matches our visual experience, then we identify it as such without trying
   to identify individual components - think of how we see a car rather than a
   door, a hood, etc. If it does not, we try to identify the object by
   identifying individual components and trying to make sense of it together,
   or Recognition by Components (RBC), introduced by 
   @biederman_recognition-by-components_1987 .
   
   Especially with limited silhouetted images like this one, identification is
   done by applying heuristics. Gestalt principles (introduced by Max Wertheimer
   [@king_max_2005], and claimed by @todorovic_gestalt_2008 as still
   applicable to modern perception theory) are fundamental in defining here
   how we perceive objects top-down.
   
   So in this instance, the experience of having seen snow-covered buildings,
   especially those with slanting roofs, is the experience necessary to perceive
   the image as 'snow-covered buildings', let alone farm buildings. The
   environment one grows up in shapes the patterns their brains focus on
   recognising (Experience-dependent plasticity, described by
   @blakemore_development_1970). The ideal environment to grow up in to identify
   the image right away would be a snow-heavy area with frequent near-whiteouts
   and slanting roofs.
   
   Given that most Indians will not have seen such a scene - with different
   experiences on building styles and climate, they do not instantly fit the 
   model of a snow-covered farmhouse to the stimuli. Rather, they try to process
   it bottom-up, identifying components and building a reasonable approximation,
   aka RBC [@biederman_recognition-by-components_1987]. Interestingly, they will
   also tend to ignore the whitespace altogether, not bothering to see how it
   might fit together to form an image.
   
   I attempted to observe this phenomenon concretely, and asked seven Indians
   what they saw in the image. One of them has been living in Boston for three
   years, and recognised the image as a house with snow instantly, demonstrating
   the impact of experience on perception. With the other six, none of them got
   it in the first try. The following features were noticed:
   
   - None of them initially considered the whitespace to be a key feature of the
     image
   - A lot of the initial answers were dragon/flying dinosaur/bird. People
     seemed to identify the larger triangle as misshapen wings and went with the
     closest flying animal in their imagination. It has been suggested that the
     dinosaur trend was due to Google Chrome's offline dinosaur game, which also
     builds a dinosaur from blocky grey splotches.
   - All of the guesses could be attributed to bottom-up processing. When
     someone guessed "two mountains and a valley", they identified the two
     triangles as mountains and the middle strip as a river. When someone
     identified a "mountain, a sailboat, and a jetty", they took the large and
     small triangles as the mountain and sailboat respectively, and the jetty
     was made by identifying negative space - the only such instance.
   - All participants were given hints about trying to guess with respect to it
     being:
     
     1. Something not seen often in India
     2. If seen in India, in the north - the Himalayas
     3. It has something to do with the climate
     4. It's a house
     
     Most people guessed by Step 3. One person guessed at Step 1, and two people
     took till Step 4 of whom one did not see it even after.
   - Some other common first guesses were:
       1. Broken sphinx
       2. Anime Hair
       3. 2004 graphics superman
       4. Robot Dog
   - Even after getting it one person kept seeing the roof in the front as a
     garbage dump - like in Tom and Jerry, or the Maguire Spider-man movies - as
     that was the experience they have had and not seeing a farmhouse.

2. **“Mirror Neuron Theory is a myth.” Explain the mirror neuron theory based on 
   Giacomo Rizzolatti’s work. What are the criticisms against it and what is 
   your opinion on this debate?**
   
   - Explanation:
       - Broadly, the mirror neuron theory posits that "motor representation is
         at the basis of the understanding of motor events"
         [@rizzolatti_premotor_1996]. The same neurons react not only to doing
         an action, but also watching it.
       - [@rizzolatti_premotor_1996]'s work noted that mirror neurons
         exist in the frontal F5 area of the Macaque monkey, and these respond
         *both* when monkeys make active movements, and when they observe
         someone make meaningful movements. They also suggested that data of how
         observation of motor actions activated the posterior part of the 
         inferior frontal gyrus in humans implied the existence of mirror
         neurons in humans too, which could be affecting verbal development in
         humans due to the homology of F5 with Broca's area.
   - Criticisms:
       - It is not possible to study individual neurons in the human brain, so
         all the information for their existence is indirect.
       - @pascolo_mirror-neuron_2009 claim that it is not clear whether mirror
         neurons really form a distinct class of cells, as opposed to an
         occasional phenomenon seen in cells that have other functions.
       - @hickok_eight_2009 argues that "The early hypothesis that these cells 
         underlie action understanding is likewise an interesting and prima 
         facie reasonable idea. However, despite its widespread acceptance, the 
         proposal has never been adequately tested in monkeys, and in humans 
         there is strong empirical evidence, in the form of physiological and 
         neuropsychological (double-) dissociations, against the claim."
