1. **What is the number of people with access to the internet today? Do all of 
   them have equal and unrestricted access to the internet?**
   
   Around *4.57 billion people* across the world [^statint]  have
   access to the internet today. Other statistics point it at being around
   *50% of the world's population*[^owidint] [^wbint], which would bring the 
   number a little below 4 billion people. This includes people accessing the
   internet from any device, both mobile phones and desktop devices.
   
   Not everyone has equal access - broadband subscription percentage is only
   *40%* in countries like South Korea and Germany [^owidac]. Some countries
   also restrict access to the internet, such as China's great firewall 
   [^wpchfw] [^lawchfw].
   
2. **How many pages/websites exist as part of the internet? What percent of them 
   belong to the surface web and the Deep/Dark web?**
   
   *Indexed pages*: A 2017 report [^seind] mentions that Google's index contains
   over *130 trillion* pages. The listed source, Google's [howsearchworks
   page], currently places a vague figure of "hundreds of billions"
   
   *Deep web*: Often confused with the dark web, it's much larger than that.
   Commonly cited research from 2001 estimates that the Deep Web as a whole is
   *400 to 500 times the size of the "surface web"* [^deest]. Assuming the
   estimates to carry over, that would put it at around *650,000 trillion*
   pages.
   
   *Dark web*: It's a bit hard to get exact figures on the size of the Dark Web,
   but a reasonable proxy is Tor traffic percentages. One of the founders of the
   Tor project has said [^torperc] that only around *3% of Tor traffic* was
   used to connect to "Hidden services". This puts the estimate at around
   *19,500 trillion* pages.
   
3. **What is the volume of internet traffic that flows through the internet 
   daily?**
   
   Based on Cisco predictions of monthly data usages in 2020 [^cisco],
   
   - Fixed internet traffic: *3.8 EB/day*
   - Mobile internet traffic: *1.36 EB/day*

4. **What is the size of the internet in total data today? (Include all media 
   content + text as well as other data in your estimation)**
   
   As of 2019 [^datap], around 16 Zettabytes (ZB) of data has been generated
   till date. This is an aggregate, for both text and media content.
   
5. **What are the most popular 3-4 web server frameworks for hosting websites? 
   What is their market share?**

   | Server Name      | Percentage market share |
   |------------------|-------------------------|
   | Apache           | 36.3%                   |
   | Nginx            | 32.4%                   |
   | Cloudfare server | 15.9%                   |
   | Microsoft-IIS    | 7.8%                    |
   | LiteSpeed        | 7.1%                    |
