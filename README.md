# Semester 7

My attempt to maintain my life failed about halfway into the Semester, and that
shows. I blame a specific course that people might notice. That said the lack of
exams does mean I almost aced the semester.

I do however have most of my submissions correctly linked on the website,
and the rest is on the repository regardless.
